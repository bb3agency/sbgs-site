# Backend Core — Changelog

Semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). This file is the **propagation instruction set**: each entry tells every client repo exactly what to apply when syncing this core version. See `docs/PLATFORM_VERSIONING_AND_SYNC_GUIDE.md`.

- **PATCH** — bug/security fix, no contract change. Safe to merge into all clients.
- **MINOR** — backward-compatible feature. Ships **OFF** behind a flag where it adds surface area.
- **MAJOR** — breaking change / migration required. Deliberate per-client upgrade.

Each entry MUST carry the **Propagation** block (layers · migration · flag · design impact · severity · breaking · rollback).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.13] — 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Per-variant `keepUpright` packing constraint.** New `ProductVariant.keepUpright` boolean (default `false`) for fragile / "this side up" / liquid items. When set, the cartonization packer only rotates the item about its vertical axis (its configured height stays the height) so the computed box reflects how the parcel actually ships. Wired through products schemas/types/service (create + single variant create/update), the admin product editor (checkbox on add + edit rows and the primary-variant card), the shipping worker, and the cart chargeable-weight quote.
- **Recommended packing box on the admin order detail** (`GET /admin/orders/:id` → `packingBox`). `adminGetOrderById` now runs the live `cartonize` engine over the order's variant dimensions + configured box presets and returns the exact L×W×H + weight + source/boxName used to rate the order, so the merchant sees which carton to pack into. Optional field (only on the detail route; other order responses omit it).

### Changed
- **Cartonization model is now stable flat-stacking instead of pure min-volume.** `computeBoundingBox` pre-orients every free item to its stable flat orientation (largest face down, smallest dimension vertical) and packs with vertical-axis rotation only. This fixes a latent **under-billing** risk where the old min-volume search could stand a large item on its end to find an unrealistically tight "thin column" box (smaller than the parcel the merchant actually ships). Candidate footprints now also include the actual item dimensions, and ties are broken by **smallest footprint then smallest longest side**, so the packer finds the realistic stacked box for the common "large item fills the floor, smaller items stack on top" pack (e.g. base 15×10×4 + two 10×5×2 → exactly 15×10×6, not the equal-volume 15×15×4; base 38×25×10 + two 25×13×5 → 38×25×15).
- **Default safety padding reduced from +2 cm to +1 cm** per dimension (`DEFAULT_PACKING_PADDING_CM`), better matching tight-packing merchants while still never undersizing.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (shipping accuracy + new optional fields) · Layers: backend (`common/shipping/cartonize.ts`, `chargeable-weight.ts`, `queues/workers/shipping.worker.ts`, `modules/products/products.{schemas,types,service}.ts`, `modules/cart/cart.service.ts`, `modules/orders/orders.{service,schemas}.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Migration: **YES** — `20260628120000_add_variant_keep_upright` adds `ProductVariant.keepUpright BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false` (non-breaking; backfills `false`). Run `prisma migrate deploy` + `prisma generate` on each client.
- Flag: n/a (additive; defaults to old free-rotation behavior when `keepUpright=false`) · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the listed files + the migration (drop the column).
- Ops note: pairs with frontend-core 0.1.8 (admin editor keepUpright checkbox). Padding change slightly lowers computed box sizes — re-quotes remain quote==billed.

## [0.1.12] — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Store identity/contact in the public store config.** `GET /store/config` (`getPublicStoreConfig`) now returns `storeName`, `storeAddress` (from `StoreSettings.sellerAddress`), `storeState`, `contactEmail`, `contactPhone` so the storefront can render a merchant-managed address/contact (footer, contact surfaces) without admin auth. All merchant-editable in Admin → Settings → Store; no schema change (reuses existing fields).

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (additive public-config fields) · Layers: backend (`modules/settings/settings.service.ts`, `settings.schemas.ts`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO (purely additive)
- Rollback: revert the two settings files
- Ops note: pairs with frontend-core 0.1.7 (footer reads these). Address shown = `StoreSettings.sellerAddress`.


## [0.1.11] — 2026-06-22

### Removed
- **Dead `selectBestFitBox`** (volume-only box picker) deleted from `common/shipping/select-box-preset.ts` — superseded by the 3D `cartonize` engine (0.1.9). `parseBoxPresets` + the `BoxPreset` type remain (used by cart/worker/settings). Its volume-only tests were dropped; 3D box selection is covered by `cartonize.test.ts`.

### Changed
- **`shiprocket.adapter.ts`**: clarified the `15×15×10` dimension fallback is a last-resort guard only (the AWB worker always passes cartonized dimensions now).
- **Docs**: integration guide §6.0 documents shipping cartonization (variant dims → box presets / bounding box → volumetric billing; quote == billed).

**Propagation:**
- Severity: LOW (dead-code removal + comments/docs; no behavior change) · Layers: backend (`common/shipping/select-box-preset.ts`, `modules/shipping/adapters/shiprocket.adapter.ts`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO (no remaining callers of `selectBestFitBox`)
- Rollback: restore the function

## [0.1.10] — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **`core-manifest.json`**: `backend/queues/**` added to `backendCore.include`. The BullMQ workers/queues are shared core but were never core-synced — so the 0.1.9 cartonization wiring in `queues/workers/shipping.worker.ts` could not propagate. Now they're in scope (clients verified identical to template before enabling, zero drift). This + the 0.1.9 `components/admin/**` inclusion close the two remaining "core code that wasn't core-synced" gaps.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (manifest scope only) · Layers: `core-manifest.json` + `backend/queues/**` now in scope
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the manifest include line
- Ops note: because `queues/**` and `components/admin/**` were newly added to scope, the 0.1.9→0.1.10 worker + admin-editor files were delivered to existing clients by a one-time deterministic `git checkout <tag> -- <file>` (version-delta sync can't retroactively pull files for a path that wasn't in the client's manifest when the change shipped). Future changes in these paths propagate normally.

## [0.1.9] — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Multi-item box cartonization** (`src/common/shipping/cartonize.ts`) — computes the ACTUAL shipping box for an order so the dimensions sent to Shiprocket/Delhivery match the parcel couriers bill on (volumetric weight = L×W×H ÷ 5000). A conservative 3D Extreme-Point first-fit-decreasing packer (never undersizes): uses the smallest Ops **catalog box** the items physically fit into, else a **computed bounding box**, then adds +2 cm safety padding. Returns L×W×H + total weight.
- **`core-manifest.json`**: `frontend/components/admin/**` added to `frontendCore.include` so the admin console is now core-synced (it was the only admin path missing — `app/(admin)` pages, `actions/`, `hooks/` were already core). Verified both clients' admin was already identical to template (zero divergence) before enabling.

### Changed
- **AWB worker** (`queues/workers/shipping.worker.ts`) now sends cartonized dimensions on every shipment (was: volume-only best-fit that only set dims when presets existed, else the adapter's `15×15×10` default).
- **`chargeable-weight.ts`** routes through the same `cartonize` engine, so the cart rate quote's volumetric weight equals what the courier later bills (quote == billed).

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (shipping accuracy + manifest scope; no breaking API change)
- Layers: backend (`common/shipping/cartonize.ts` [new], `chargeable-weight.ts`, `queues/workers/shipping.worker.ts`), `core-manifest.json`
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the three shipping files + the manifest include line
- Ops note: per-variant box dimensions (length/width/height) drive accuracy — ensure variants have them set (now fully editable in the admin product editor, frontend-core 0.1.5). Optional: configure standard carton sizes as box presets in Ops to switch to catalog cartonization.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Client extension layer for frontend components.** `core-manifest.json` now excludes `frontend/components/client/**` — the canonical home for per-client component variants (alongside the existing `frontend/app/(client)/**` for pages and `backend/src/modules/client/**` for backend). Client-only UI that previously had to live in core paths (`components/cart`, `components/layout`, …) now has a non-core home and won't trip the drift gate.

### Changed
- **`check-core-drift.sh` failure message** now spells out the full client extension layer (pages → `app/(client)/**`, components → `components/client/**`, backend → `src/modules/client/**`) so the fix path is obvious when the gate fires.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (manifest/tooling; no runtime/API change)
- Layers: `core-manifest.json` [core], `backend/scripts/check-core-drift.sh` [core]
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the manifest exclude + script message
- Ops note: existing clients that built client-only UI into core paths should move it to `components/client/**` / `app/(client)/**` (URLs unchanged for route-group page moves). See guide §1.1.

## [0.1.7] — 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- **`check-core-drift.sh` false positives across layers.** The gate built one combined backend+frontend pathspec and diffed it against *each* tag. Since tags are full-repo snapshots, that cross-checked frontend files against the backend tag (and vice-versa) → spurious "drift" whenever backend and frontend are pinned to different commits (e.g. backend 0.1.6 / frontend 0.1.4). Now each layer is diffed against **its own** tag (`backendCore`→`backend-core-v*`, `frontendCore`→`frontend-core-v*`). Verified green on raghava at 0.1.6/0.1.4.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (gate correctness; no runtime/API change)
- Layers: backend (`scripts/check-core-drift.sh`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the script
- Ops note: re-enable the gate per client with Variable `CORE_DRIFT_ENABLED=true` once this lands.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-06-22

> Note: tags `0.1.3`–`0.1.5` were cut without CHANGELOG/`package.json`/`PLATFORM_VERSION` bumps on main; this entry realigns those markers and supersedes the `sync-core.mjs` engine introduced in `0.1.2`.

### Changed
- **`backend/scripts/sync-core.mjs` rewritten as a cruft/copier-style THREE-WAY MERGE engine.** Instead of `git checkout <tag> -- <paths>` (a wholesale overwrite that silently discarded client-local edits and could regress markers), it now applies the **delta** between the client's currently-pinned core tag and the requested tag via `git apply --3way`. Result: client-local edits to unrelated lines survive; only genuine overlaps produce conflict markers (which fail CI → resolved in the PR); **file deletions and renames between versions are now applied** (the old engine could not); `PLATFORM_VERSION` only ever advances (downgrade guard); first-time syncs (no baseline tag) fall back to wholesale checkout.
- **`backend/scripts/check-core-drift.sh` is now a true HARD GATE.** Adds `CORE_DRIFT_STRICT=true` mode (CI): a missing prerequisite (jq / `template` remote / pinned tag) becomes a build FAILURE instead of a silent skip; local dev still skips cleanly. Also now actually honors `approved-divergence` (previously read but unused — those paths are excluded from the gate).

### Added
- **`.github/workflows/core-drift.yml`** (infra, per-client) — runs the strict drift gate on every PR/push: wires the template remote + jq and fails the build on unsanctioned core drift. Self-guards to client repos (inert where `TEMPLATE_REPO` var is unset); opt-out via repo Variable `CORE_DRIFT_ENABLED=false`.
- **`.github/workflows/core-sync.yml`** (infra, per-client) hardened: gates on OPEN PRs only (a closed/merged PR no longer blocks a fresh one); always regenerates the branch from current main (strictly-ahead → clean FF, no stale merge); never reopens (avoids head-desync); sets `delete_branch_on_merge` best-effort; labels PRs `core-sync` / `has-conflicts` and surfaces conflict files in the body.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (process/tooling hardening; no runtime/API change)
- Layers: backend (`scripts/sync-core.mjs`, `scripts/check-core-drift.sh`) [core-synced] · workflows `core-sync.yml`+`core-drift.yml` [infra, copy per repo]
- Migration: NO
- Flag: n/a (gate opt-out via `CORE_DRIFT_ENABLED=false`)
- Design impact: none
- Breaking: NO — but after adopting, clients MUST keep core files identical to the pinned tag (the new gate enforces it); pre-existing drift must be upstreamed or recorded as `approved-divergence` before the gate goes green
- Rollback: revert the two scripts + remove `core-drift.yml`
- Ops note: workflows are infra (not core-synced) — copy `core-sync.yml`+`core-drift.yml` into each client once. The engine (`sync-core.mjs`, `check-core-drift.sh`) propagates via the normal core sync.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-06-21

### Added
- **`backend/scripts/sync-core.mjs`** — core-sync engine: pulls core files for a release tag into a client (`git checkout <tag> -- <core paths>`, design/client/approved-divergence excluded), refreshes the layer CHANGELOG, bumps `PLATFORM_VERSION`. Exposed as `npm run sync:core`.

### Changed
- **`check-core-drift.sh` / `check-token-contract.sh`** now skip cleanly (exit 0) when there is no `template` remote or `jq` is absent, and are wired into `ci:reliability-gates` — so CI stays green everywhere and the gates self-activate where the prerequisites exist.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL
- Layers: backend (`scripts/sync-core.mjs` [new], `scripts/check-core-drift.sh`, `scripts/check-token-contract.sh`, `package.json` scripts)
- Migration: NO
- Flag: n/a
- Design impact: none
- Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the scripts; remove the `sync:core` alias
- Ops note: the `release-train.yml` (template) + `core-sync.yml` (client) workflows are infra, bootstrapped per repo (not auto-synced). Install `jq` on the runner to activate the gates.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **Guest cart lost in production (vanished on refresh/navigation + post-login merge found nothing):** the `cart_session` cookie was issued `SameSite=Strict` and cart responses carried no `Cache-Control`. Two compounding causes:
  1. **`SameSite=Strict`** is the wrong policy for a guest cart session — it is dropped on top-level navigations (external-link arrivals, payment/redirect returns, the login→checkout round-trip), orphaning the guest cart and leaving the post-login `POST /cart/merge` with no guest session to merge. Now `SameSite=Lax` (same-origin XHR unaffected).
  2. **No `Cache-Control` on cart responses** — behind a CDN/edge (Cloudflare) a GET cart response could be cached and have its `Set-Cookie` stripped, serving a stale/empty cart to all guests and dropping the session (prod-only, no edge locally). Now every cart route sends `Cache-Control: no-store`.
  Cookie logic extracted to a tested `cart-cookies.ts` helper that also makes `Secure` environment-aware (omitted in dev/test for local http), mirroring `auth-cookies.ts`.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL
- Layers: backend (`src/modules/cart/cart-cookies.ts` [new] + test · `src/modules/cart/cart.routes.ts`)
- Migration: NO
- Flag: n/a
- Design impact: none
- Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the cart cookie helper + routes change (restores `SameSite=Strict` and drops `no-store`)
- Ops note: no infra change required — `no-store` is sent by the origin; if a Cloudflare Cache Rule force-caches `/api/v1/cart*`, exclude it so origin `Cache-Control` is honoured

- **Product image upload reliability (three independent bugs that compounded into intermittent 400/500/"sometimes uploads but errors"):**
  1. **Response serialization 500** — the `/admin/products/:id/images/upload` handler returned the raw Prisma row (with `createdAt`/`updatedAt`); the `oneOf` response schema (`additionalProperties:false`) made `fast-json-stringify` throw `"The value of '#' does not match schema definition"` → 500 **after** the image was already saved to R2 + DB (hence "uploaded but errored"). Now maps to the declared DTO shape.
  2. **Declared-MIME false rejection** — uploads 400'd with `"Image content does not match declared file type"` when the browser/OS MIME differed from the actual bytes (renamed files, non-standard `image/jpg` vs `image/jpeg`, phone exports). The magic-byte–detected type is now authoritative; the untrusted declared MIME is ignored for acceptance (storage already used the detected type). Only true JPEG/PNG/WebP/GIF accepted — security preserved.
  3. **Nginx upload path** — `auth_request` (maintenance gate) on `/api/v1/admin/` buffered the whole multipart body before the subrequest and 500'd on larger images (the POST never reached the backend). Added a dedicated `^/api/v1/admin/.+/images/upload$` location that skips the gate and streams the body (`proxy_request_buffering off`).

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL
- Layers: backend (`src/modules/products/products.routes.ts`, `src/modules/media/product-media.validation.ts` + test) · infra (`nginx/client.conf.template`)
- Migration: NO
- Flag: n/a
- Design impact: none
- Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the three changes; for nginx, remove the upload `location` block and re-render
- Ops note: the nginx change must be applied to each client's live `/etc/nginx/sites-available/<domain>` (re-render from template or hand-insert) + `nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx`
