# Next.js Frontends — Integration Guide (Storefront + Admin)

This guide describes how a **single Next.js frontend app** serving storefront and admin routes should integrate with **this** Fastify API. **Endpoint index:** `docs/API_ENDPOINT_INDEX.md`. **API contract source of truth:** `TRD.md` section 7 (all paths), section 4.4 (response envelope), section 4.5 (error codes), section 6 (auth), section 12 (frontend technical requirements), section 11.5 (PCI / CSP ownership). **Business flows:** `BRD.md`. **Architecture context:** `ECOM_MASTER.md` (modular monolith, per-client isolation, Nginx routing). All routes are under **`/api/v1/`** (`TRD.md` §7.1).

**Lifecycle:** This is a **build-time integration document**. After development/go-live, use `docs/CLIENT_HANDOFF_INDEX.md` and linked Client-Main docs as primary client-facing references.

---

## 1. Base URLs and environment variables

| Variable | Example | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_URL` | `https://client1.com` | Canonical browser origin; redirects, links, Razorpay `callback_url` context; SSR image absolute URLs when CDN unset (**must be set in production**) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | `https://client1.com/api/v1` **or** dedicated API host | Browser-facing API prefix (**must** include `/api/v1`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_CDN_URL` | `https://cdn.client1.com` | Product image CDN prefix — must match Ops `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in production |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` | `rzp_live_xxx` | **Public** key only — never put key secret in Next bundle |
| Server-only `INTERNAL_API_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:<BACKEND_PORT>/api/v1` | Optional SSR/server-actions bypass of public DNS (same machine as Nginx/backend) |

**Do not use build-time env vars for storefront module flags or COD.** Fetch **`GET /api/v1/store/config`** instead (see §1.2). Legacy `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_*` keys in `.env.example` are not authoritative for customer UI.

### 1.2 Runtime public store config (`GET /api/v1/store/config`)

Public, no auth. Returns only customer-safe fields:

| Field | Source | Storefront use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `isCodEnabled` | DB `StoreSettings` | Show/hide COD at checkout |
| `minOrderValuePaise` | DB `StoreSettings` | Block checkout below minimum (0 = none) |
| `mobileOtpSignupEnabled` | DB `StoreSettings` | Show mobile OTP signup tab |
| `couponsEnabled` | Backend `FEATURE_COUPONS_ENABLED` | Cart coupon UI, PDP promos |
| `reviewsEnabled` | Backend `FEATURE_REVIEWS_ENABLED` | PDP reviews, homepage testimonials |
| `wishlistEnabled` | Backend `FEATURE_WISHLIST_ENABLED` | Wishlist buttons |
| `gstInvoicingEnabled` | Backend `FEATURE_GST_INVOICING_ENABLED` | Admin GST field visibility (also fetched client-side in admin panels) |

**This repo wiring:**
- RSC: `getPublicStoreConfig()` in `lib/storefront-settings.ts` with `next: { revalidate: 60 }`.
- Client: `fetchPublicStoreConfigClient()` for admin GST panels and register page.
- Provider: `StoreConfigProvider` in `app/(storefront)/layout.tsx`; hooks via `useStoreConfig()`.
- **Fail-closed:** When fetch fails, `configAvailable: false` — disable COD, coupons, wishlist, and block checkout until config loads.

**Invoice download (customer + admin):** Use `order.invoice?.hasPdf === true` from `GET /orders/:id` — not `gstInvoicingEnabled` and not a direct `pdfUrl` field.

**Admin nav:** Coupons and Reviews nav items are always shown so merchants can moderate/configure even when storefront modules are disabled via feature flags.

**Cookie domains:** backend sets **`refresh_token`** and **`cart_session`** with `httpOnly`, `sameSite: 'strict'`, and `Secure` in production-like profiles (`TRD.md` §8.3, constraint C-20). Development/test omits `Secure` on `refresh_token` (`auth-cookies.ts`). The refresh cookie uses **`Path=/api/v1`** (not site-wide `/`) so it is only sent to API routes. Frontends **must** call the API on the **same site** as the browser UI so cookies are stored and sent on `credentials: 'include'` requests.

### 1.0.2 Session refresh security model (admin + customer)

| Control | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Access token | Short-lived JWT in memory (Zustand) only — not `localStorage` |
| Refresh token | `httpOnly` cookie; rotated on every `POST /auth/refresh` (single-use CAS) |
| CSRF | `SameSite=Strict` on refresh cookie — cross-site pages cannot trigger refresh |
| Device binding | Refresh tokens bound to **User-Agent + client IP** (from trusted proxy). Mismatch revokes the session family |
| Failed refresh | Backend clears `refresh_token` cookie on `401` |
| Client restore | `restore-auth-session.ts` dedupes refresh (React Strict Mode safe) |
| Admin OTP login | Verify-otp route forwards the same risk context as refresh (required for binding) |

**Threat model notes:** Session persistence after reload is intentional when the refresh cookie is valid. Stolen-cookie abuse is mitigated by rotation, binding, and `Secure`/`httpOnly`/`SameSite` — not by disabling refresh. Configure **`TRUSTED_PROXY_ALLOWLIST_CIDR`** on the VPS so Nginx-forwarded client IPs are correct (`backend/.env` / Ops UI).

### 1.0.1 Local development — same-site API (required for admin/customer session refresh)

Do **not** point `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` at `http://localhost:3000/api/v1` while the Next.js app runs on `http://localhost:3101` — the browser will not send `refresh_token` across ports and **admin refresh after page reload will fail**.

| Variable | Local value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:3101/api/v1` | Browser + `apiClient` (same origin as storefront) |
| `BACKEND_PROXY_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:3000` | Next.js rewrite target (`frontend/next.config.ts`) |
| `INTERNAL_API_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1` | SSR, server actions, Vitest integration tests |

Implementation: `frontend/lib/api-base.ts` (auto-corrects legacy cross-port public URL in the browser) + `frontend/lib/restore-auth-session.ts` (deduped `POST /auth/refresh` on load). **`npm run dev` runs `scripts/ensure-backend-dev.mjs` first** — it probes `BACKEND_PROXY_URL/api/v1/health/live` and exits with start instructions if the Fastify API is down (prevents `ECONNREFUSED` proxy spam). Start backend via `backend/scripts/dev-up.cmd` or `cd backend && npm run dev` **before** the frontend. Restart `npm run dev` after changing env.

**Mobile/LAN dev:** `next.config.ts` auto-adds non-internal IPv4 addresses to `allowedDevOrigins` (plus optional `ALLOWED_DEV_ORIGINS`). Sign in on the **same network URL** shown by `npm run dev` (e.g. `http://192.168.x.x:3101/admin/login`) — refresh cookies are host-scoped.

Verification:

1. `curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/health` → ok  
2. With Next on 3101: `curl http://localhost:3101/api/v1/health` → ok (rewrite)  
3. Admin login → DevTools → Cookies on **`localhost:3101`** → `refresh_token` present  
4. Hard refresh `/admin` → stays signed in  

### 1.1 Frontend AI implementation brief (mandatory)

For any AI agent generating frontend code, enforce these constraints:

1. Use only `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (with `/api/v1`) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_URL`.
2. Build API client parsers that accept both success modes (enveloped + raw) controlled by `FEATURE_RESPONSE_ENVELOPE_ENABLED`.
3. For critical mutations, send `idempotency-key` header.
4. Use PREPAID vs COD checkout split exactly as documented; never call `/payments/initiate` for COD orders.
5. Never call `/payments/webhook` or `/shipping/webhook` from browser code.
6. Branch UX on `error.code` only; never parse free-form `error.message`.
7. Treat `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=noop` and `SHIPPING_PROVIDER=noop` as dev-only, never production.
8. Treat shipment booking as manual-only admin action (`POST /api/v1/admin/orders/:id/ship`) and use backend ship-state fields (`canShipNow`, `shipBlockReason`, `shippingMode`) to drive button enablement and messaging.
9. If frontend work reveals a reusable backend fix, classify it as template-worthy and follow the manual upstream command protocol in `docs/MASTER_DEPLOYMENT_PLAYBOOK.md` §3.2.2.

Before release sign-off, execute `docs/FRONTEND_AI_GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md` and attach it with `docs/BACKEND_GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md` in the deployment evidence package. The backend checklist must cover full environment-to-implementation parity for all required backend env groups, not only payment/shipping provider checks. It also includes audit-hardened gates: Nginx security headers verification, JSON schema `additionalProperties: false` enforcement, SLO alert test coverage, JWT fail-fast validation, script credential env var usage, and admin route rate-limit/load-shed guards.

Also include provider lifecycle evidence from `docs/CLIENT_INTEGRATION_CREDENTIAL_REGISTER_TEMPLATE.md` (owner, vault path, created/rotated/expiry, last-tested) and ensure frontend rules sync is verified (`frontend-agent-rules.md` -> `.agents/rules/dev-rules.md`).

For provider onboarding, frontend/public-vs-secret env boundaries, and key rotation/incident procedures, follow `docs/THIRD_PARTY_INTEGRATIONS_SETUP_AND_KEY_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`.

Operational semantics to preserve in frontend behavior:
- **Admin permission changes are token-issuance scoped.** If permissions are granted/revoked, force token refresh or logout/re-auth before expecting immediate UI/API permission changes.
- **Admin refund status requests are deferred.** UI should show an in-progress/pending-refund state until worker/provider confirmation finalizes `REFUNDED`.
- **Idempotency key collisions are now atomic-safe.** Backend uses CAS (Compare-And-Swap) patterns for idempotent request recording. Frontend can safely retry mutations with the same `Idempotency-Key` header on 503/504 errors; concurrent identical requests result in one execution, others return cached response (no double-charge).
- **Concurrent mutation handling:** Backend state transitions are guarded by atomic checks (e.g., invite consumption, token refresh). If two users/requests race, one wins and the other receives `409 CONFLICT` with descriptive code. Frontend should handle `409` by refreshing state and retrying if appropriate, not blindly repeating the mutation.
- **Audit chain lock contention:** Under very high concurrent ops activity, ops write endpoints may return `503 ops_audit_chain_lock_timeout`. Frontend should treat this as retryable after a short backoff (1–2 seconds), not a failure.

### 1.2 Recommended delivery model: simultaneous build + integration (mandatory practice)

For this stack, the most reliable way to ship with an **ops/admin-first implementation and storefront-last rollout** is **contract-first vertical slices**.

Do **not** build all pages first and integrate APIs later.

Build each capability as one slice:

1. lock API contract for the slice,
2. build typed API client methods,
3. build UI,
4. integrate with real backend module,
5. add targeted tests,
6. mark slice done only after behavior + permissions + error handling are validated.

#### 1.2.1 Why this is required in this backend

- Backend behavior includes asynchronous transitions (webhook -> queue -> worker -> final status), so UI-only completion is misleading.
- Permission outcomes are layered (`admin/*` vs `ops/*`) and can look correct visually while still failing at runtime if integrated late.
- Idempotency and reconciliation behaviors can only be trusted when tested against real module paths.

#### 1.2.2 Delivery sequence (execution order)

Use this order unless there is a strong project-specific reason to change it:

1. **Foundation slice**
   - API client, auth state, refresh-on-401, global error mapper (`error.code` driven), permission-aware navigation.
   - Zustand stores for auth and cart. Response envelope parser that handles both enveloped `{ success, data, meta? }` and raw shapes.

2. **Ops control plane slices**
   - Session bootstrap (`GET /ops/session`), load-shed change (`POST /ops/load-shed` applies immediately with OTP confirmation), audit timeline (`GET /ops/audit/logs`).
   - Ops config surfaces (`/ops/config/overview`, `/ops/config/stored`, `/ops/config/save`) with masked secret behavior and restart semantics.
   - Ops surfaces are platform staff only (`/api/v1/ops/*`) — never proxy merchant actions through ops APIs.

3. **Admin read slices**
   - Dashboard KPIs/charts, orders list/detail, inventory list, product list + categories, customer index + CRM view.
   - Build these before mutations so you have real data to validate mutation outcomes against.

4. **Admin mutation slices (high-risk)**
   - Order status updates, ship action (triggers shipping provider — run provider dry-run simultaneously), cancel/refund (async — UI must show pending-refund state until worker finalises), stock adjustment (`PATCH /admin/inventory/:variantId`), bulk stock adjustment (`POST /admin/inventory/bulk-update`, max 100 items), settings updates.
   - Razorpay checkout (PREPAID) and COD checkout slices belong here — run the Razorpay test payment dry-run during this tier.
   - Return request detail (`GET /admin/return-requests/:id`) and approval/rejection (`PATCH /admin/return-requests/:id`).
   - Customer account moderation: ban (`PATCH /admin/users/:id/ban`), unban (`DELETE /admin/users/:id/ban`), admin notes (`POST /DELETE /admin/users/:id/notes`). Ban does not cancel existing orders — those must be managed separately. UI should reflect `isBanned`, `bannedAt`, `bannedReason` from the user detail response.
   - Product variant management: create/update variant plus `DELETE /admin/products/:id/variants/:variantId` (blocked with 400 if last variant on product).
   - Coupon lifecycle (create/edit/disable, restore soft-deleted, verify application at checkout, verify expired coupon errors). Coupon audit trail at `GET /admin/coupons/:id/audit`.

5. **Reliability/operations slices**
   - Reconciliation issues, outbox dead-letter replay-preview → replay, inbox failures replay-preview → replay, analytics (revenue, funnel, category breakdown, inventory alerts, notification delivery), Bull Board queue visibility.

6. **Storefront customer journey slices (build after ops + admin tiers are solid)**
   - Catalogue: product list, category pages, search, product detail (`/products`, `/products/:slug`, `/products/categories`).
   - Cart: guest session, item CRUD, coupon apply/remove, pincode check, merge-on-login (`POST /cart/merge`).
   - Checkout: full PREPAID Razorpay sequence (`POST /payments/prepare-checkout` → Razorpay modal → `POST /payments/confirm-prepaid`) and COD path (`POST /orders` with `paymentMode: 'COD'`).
   - Order history, order detail, return request creation, shipment tracking (`GET /shipping/track/:awb`).
   - Customer auth: OTP flow, email login, forgot-password, refresh loop, logout.
   - User profile + addresses CRUD.
   - Feature-flagged slices (wishlist, reviews, coupons) only if `FEATURE_*_ENABLED` is active for this client.
   - Run the email (Resend) dry-run during checkout slice — trigger order confirmation, confirm email arrives at test inbox.

#### 1.2.2A Shipping capability guardrails for future iterations

Current behavior and future extension constraints:

- Shipment booking remains **manual-only**: merchant/admin explicitly clicks **Ship Order**; payment confirmation never auto-creates shipments.
- Keep using admin ship-state fields (`canShipNow`, `shipBlockReason`, `shippingMode`) as the frontend contract for ship-action eligibility.

If shipping capability is extended in future (for example stricter fulfillment checks or configurable SOP templates), preserve the following invariants:

- Never bypass `canShipNow` / `shipBlockReason` eligibility checks.
- Never place long-running external shipping-provider calls inside DB transactions.
- Keep shipment booking idempotent to prevent duplicate AWB creation on retries.
- Keep atomic CAS transitions (`updateMany` with guard conditions) for race safety.

Recommended future iteration targets:

- Add stricter fulfillment readiness checks (packaging/warehouse checklist gates) before enabling ship action.
- Add explicit admin audit-reason capture when shipment is booked.
- Add per-merchant configurable ship-action SOP templates in admin settings.
- If any auto-dispatch mode is introduced, gate it behind explicit feature flags and keep manual mode as default-safe behavior.

Methodology requirement for any future shipping UI/API work:

1. Freeze route contract and request/response schema before UI work.
2. Build typed API client methods for new shipping endpoints.
3. Build UI states (`loading` / `empty` / `error` / `success`) and integrate with real backend routes.
4. Validate permission boundaries (`/admin/*` scope enforcement) and shipment-booking idempotency.
5. Close slice only after happy-path + negative-path integration and UI interaction tests pass.

#### 1.2.3 Definition of done per slice (strict)

A slice is not complete until all of the following are true:

- UI renders correct happy-path and failure-path states.
- API integration is against real backend routes (not mocks only).
- Permissions are enforced twice:
  - proactive UI hide/disable by scope,
  - backend rejection handling (`401/403`) with clear recovery.
- Critical writes send `idempotency-key` and retries reuse the same key for same intent.
- Envelope/raw success parsing works for that route.
- At least one integration test and one UI interaction test pass for the slice.

#### 1.2.4 Admin + Ops boundary rules (non-negotiable)

- Merchant operations stay on `/api/v1/admin/*`.
- Platform runtime controls stay on `/api/v1/ops/*`.
- Do not route merchant actions through ops APIs to “make UI easier”.
- Do not expose ops credentials in browser storage, logs, query strings, or shared client config files.
- Ops load-shed change is a single-step action: `POST /ops/load-shed` applies immediately after OTP confirmation. There is no separate approve/reject step.

#### 1.2.5 Test cadence while building (continuous, not end-only)

**Per slice (before marking a slice done):**

- One route-level integration check against real local backend (not mocked).
- One permission negative-case check (`401/403` handled correctly, UI disables/hides before backend rejects).
- One idempotency/retry behavior check for critical mutations (order create, payment initiate, payment verify, admin ship, cancel).
- One UI interaction test (happy path + primary failure path).
- Targeted backend checklist subset from `docs/BACKEND_GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md` when the slice touches risk-critical modules (payments, shipping, auth, ops).

**At milestone boundaries (every 4–6 slices):**

- Run the full backend validation script subset used in release gates.
- Re-check BRD AC coverage mapping in §12.2 of this guide — confirm each AC row has evidence for the slices delivered so far.
- Run the full `docs/BACKEND_GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md` (not just the subset).

**When all slices are complete (before Phase 5 local gate):**

- `docs/FRONTEND_AI_GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md` must be fully ticked — every row, not deferred.
- `docs/BACKEND_GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md` must be fully ticked — full environment-to-implementation parity, not only provider checks.
- Full Postman E2E collection folders 0→1→2→3 pass.
- Manual browser walk of every user-facing flow passes (see `docs/CLIENT_ONBOARDING_EXECUTION_ORDER.md` Phase 5 execution steps for the full list).

## 2. Response envelope and errors (mandatory handling)

**Error responses** always use the standard envelope (`TRD.md` §4.4):

**Error:** `{ "success": false, "error": { "code", "message", "statusCode", "details"? } }`

**Success responses** depend on `FEATURE_RESPONSE_ENVELOPE_ENABLED`:
- **When `true`:** All 2xx JSON responses are wrapped: `{ "success": true, "data": <T>, "meta"?: { page, limit, total, totalPages } }`
- **When `false` (default):** Success responses return route-specific payloads directly (no outer `success`/`data` wrapper).

> **Frontend recommendation:** Build your API client to handle both shapes — check for `response.data` (envelope mode) and fall back to the raw response body (direct mode). This lets you toggle the flag without frontend changes.

**Exception:** CSV / binary downloads always bypass JSON envelope (`TRD.md` §4.4).

**Error codes** are **only** from `TRD.md` §4.5 — map UI copy to `error.code` (e.g. `INSUFFICIENT_STOCK`, `PINCODE_NOT_SERVICEABLE`, `COUPON_EXPIRED`, `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`). Do **not** branch on free-form `message` strings.

### 2.1 Frontend error-code handling matrix (required)

Use this matrix for both storefront and admin/ops frontend clients:

| HTTP | `error.code` | Frontend handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Map `error.details.fields[]` to form inputs (`instancePath` → field key). Highlight fields (`data-admin-field`), scroll to first error, show inline + banner copy. Use shared helpers in `frontend/lib/admin-form-validation.ts` + `useAdminFormValidation()`. Do not retry automatically. |
| 401 | `TOKEN_EXPIRED` | Run refresh-once flow (`/api/v1/auth/refresh`), retry original request once, then force login if refresh fails. |
| 401 | `UNAUTHORISED` / `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | Show auth error; redirect/login prompt for protected pages. |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | Hide/disable unauthorized actions and show access-denied state. |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | Render not-found state/page; avoid destructive retries. |
| 409 | `CONFLICT`, `INVALID_STATUS_TRANSITION`, `INSUFFICIENT_STOCK` | Refresh relevant state and show actionable conflict message. |
| 409 | `CONFLICT` (identity boundary) | For admin/ops/customer signup/invite flows, show hard-stop "email already used in another account domain" guidance. |
| 422 | `PINCODE_NOT_SERVICEABLE` | Block checkout continuation for that address and prompt alternate pincode/address. |
| 429 | `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Show retry/backoff messaging; disable repeat actions for cooldown window. |
| 500/502/503 | `INTERNAL_ERROR` and upstream failures | Show generic retry-safe error, record telemetry, and provide support escalation path. |

Operational safety rule: webhook endpoints are not browser calls; frontend should never attempt client-side retries against `/api/v1/payments/webhook`, `/api/v1/shipping/webhook`, or `/api/v1/notifications/webhook/*`.

#### 2.1.1 Admin form validation UX (required)

All merchant admin write forms must surface validation failures visibly — never show only a generic banner.

| Piece | Location | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Field map | `lib/admin-form-validation.ts` | Parse `ApiError` `VALIDATION_ERROR` → `details.fields[]`; normalize JSON Schema paths (`variants/0/sku` → `sku`). |
| Hook | `hooks/use-admin-form-validation.ts` | `validateRequired`, `handleSubmitError`, `fieldClassName`, `applyFieldErrors`. |
| Wrapper | `components/admin/AdminFormField.tsx` | Label + inline error; `data-admin-field-label` for scroll target. |
| Inputs | Each field | `data-admin-field="<key>"`; error ring uses `!border-destructive` so trailing border utilities cannot override. |
| Banner | Form header | `formatAdminValidationSummary()` appends field names/messages to the generic copy. |

**Wired forms (2026-06-06):** `AdminProductEditor` (includes required **Category** + **URL Slug** on create), `AdminCategoryEditor`, `AdminCouponForm`. Product create requires `categoryId` — if categories fail to load (backend down), show the load warning and block submit with a highlighted Category field.

For provider-facing retry/backoff boundaries (timeouts, retry eligibility, and non-idempotent safeguards), follow `docs/THIRD_PARTY_INTEGRATIONS_SETUP_AND_KEY_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` section `2.1`.

## 3. Authentication (customer)

| Step | Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Register | `POST /api/v1/auth/register` | Returns `accessToken` + `user`; sets **refresh cookie** |
| Forgot password | `POST /api/v1/auth/forgot-password` | Initiates reset flow; map errors via `error.code` |
| OTP send | `POST /api/v1/auth/send-otp` | |
| OTP verify | `POST /api/v1/auth/verify-otp` | Returns `accessToken` + `user`; sets **refresh cookie** |
| Email login | `POST /api/v1/auth/login` | |
| Refresh | `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` | Uses **cookie**, returns new access token |
| Logout | `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` | Customer auth required |

**Frontend pattern (`TRD.md` §12 + §6.4):**

1. Keep **`accessToken`** in memory (or short-lived server session) — **not** long-lived `localStorage` for refresh-grade persistence.
2. Attach **`Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`** to customer routes.
3. On **401** from a protected call: call **`/api/v1/auth/refresh`** once, retry once, then force login.
4. **Guest cart** uses **`cart_session`** cookie (`TRD.md` §8.3) — never echo session token from API bodies.

---

## 4. Authentication (admin)

| Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/admin/login/request-otp` | Admin login step 1 — verifies email + password; on success sends 6-digit OTP. Public, auth-sensitive rate-limited. **Branch on `error.code`:** advance to OTP UI only on **200** after valid active admin credentials. `401 INVALID_CREDENTIALS` = wrong password for known admin (stay on credentials, show "Incorrect password."). `401 UNAUTHORISED` = deactivated admin. Unknown email / non-admin: **200** generic message without OTP (anti-enumeration — do not reveal account existence). |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/admin/login/verify-otp` | Admin login step 2 — verifies OTP (300s TTL, max 5 attempts), issues JWT access token + sets HTTP-only refresh cookie. Admin UI **must** use role + permission scopes on every `/api/v1/admin/*` call (`TRD.md` §6.3, §7.9). |
| `GET /api/v1/ops/admin-invites` | Ops-authenticated merchant admin invite list. Requires `ops:read`. Query: `status`, `page`, `limit`. |
| `POST /api/v1/ops/admin-invites` | Ops-authenticated merchant admin invite creation (`ops:write`). Appends `/admin/setup?token=...` to `setupBaseUrl` (origin only). Allows **deactivated** merchant admin emails; blocks active admins, customers, and ops emails. |
| `POST /api/v1/ops/admin-invites/:inviteId/revoke` | Ops-authenticated invite revocation (`ops:write` + email OTP challenge). Sets `CANCELLED`. |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/invites/setup/send-otp` | Public — sends setup OTP to the invite email address. Called from `/admin/setup` before consuming the invite. Body: `{ token, name, phone? }`. |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/invites/consume` | Public but rate-limited one-time setup-token completion route for `/admin/setup`; creates `User(role=ADMIN)` and merchant `AdminPermissionGrant` rows only after valid unexpired token and OTP verification. |
| `POST /api/v1/ops/admin-invites/cleanup-expired` | Ops-authenticated cleanup of expired unconsumed merchant admin invites (`ops:write`). |

Admin UI is served as routes within the same frontend deployment (for example `/admin`), with permissions enforced by backend admin JWT scopes. Do not create a separate admin deployment/domain in the canonical model.

`/admin/setup` UX contract: read the `token` query param, render a name + password creation form. First call `POST /api/v1/admin/invites/setup/send-otp` with the token and name (phone optional) to receive an OTP at the invite email address. Then call `POST /api/v1/admin/invites/consume` with the token and OTP to complete setup. On success, redirect to admin login (`/admin/login`). **Re-invite:** if the email belonged to a deactivated merchant admin, consume **reactivates** the same `User` id (clears `isBanned`, replaces password/permissions) — do not assume a new row is always created. Do not store invite tokens in localStorage/sessionStorage/logs. Treat invalid, consumed, or expired tokens as terminal and ask the operator to issue a new invite. This flow grants merchant ecommerce permissions only; do not display or request `ops:*`, `developer:*`, provider-secret, database, Redis, or ops-control permissions from merchant setup screens.

Identity boundary contract: `User` and `OpsUser` emails are mutually exclusive for **active** accounts. Ops UI: use the **merchant admin invite** form (not the top ops-operator form) to restore deactivated merchant admins. Surface backend `409 CONFLICT` messages verbatim when specific (ops client uses `getApiErrorMessageWithHint`).

### 4.1 Layer ownership model (backend-enforced)

| Layer | Frontend visibility | Who can mutate |
|---|---|---|
| Layer A | Merchant admin UI (`/admin/*`) | `merchant` |
| Layer B | Merchant admin UI (`/admin/*`) | `merchant` (permission-gated sensitive actions) |
| Layer C | Optional read-only diagnostics in merchant UI | `developer` via `/api/v1/ops/*` only |

Treat `/api/v1/ops/*` as platform operations API, not merchant control-surface API.
Compatibility note: legacy backend grant scopes are still accepted during transition and mapped to `merchant` / `developer`.

### 4.2 Ops UI integration surface (`/api/v1/ops/*`)

For the configuration model (which keys are env-bootstrap vs db-overlay, mutability, and restart requirements), use `docs/ENV_VS_DB_CONFIG_REFERENCE.md`.

#### 4.2.1 Ops Security Model (Browser-Session-Only)

The ops control plane uses a hardened browser-session-only authentication model:

**Authentication Flow:**
1. **Step 1:** `POST /api/v1/ops/auth/login/request-otp` — Email + password verification, sends 6-digit OTP to ops user's email
2. **Step 2:** `POST /api/v1/ops/auth/login/verify-otp` — OTP verification (300s TTL, max 5 attempts), issues `ops_session` httpOnly cookie
3. **Session:** All subsequent requests automatically include the session cookie
4. **Logout:** `POST /api/v1/ops/auth/logout` — Clears session cookie and destroys Redis session

**Security Characteristics:**
| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Session Storage** | httpOnly, secure, sameSite=strict cookie |
| **Session Backend** | SHA256-hashed token in Redis with TTL (24h default) |
| **No API Keys** | Browser session only — no `x-ops-key-id` headers |
| **No localStorage** | Tokens never touch browser storage |
| **Deactivated User Check** | Live `isActive` DB check on every request |
| **Rate Limiting** | `opsCritical` tier (strictest limits) |

**Critical Operations Require OTP Verification:**
All privileged ops mutations require a second-factor OTP challenge:

| Endpoint | Action Type | OTP Required |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `POST /ops/config/save` | config-save | ✅ Yes |
| `POST /ops/load-shed` | load-shed-change | ✅ Yes |
| `POST /ops/system/restart` | system-restart | ✅ Yes |
| `POST /ops/users/:id/deactivate` | user-deactivate | ✅ Yes |
| `POST /ops/invites/:id/revoke` | invite-revoke | ✅ Yes |

**OTP Challenge Pattern for Critical Operations:**
```typescript
// 1. Request OTP challenge for specific action (body field is `action`, not actionType)
const { challengeId } = await api.post('/ops/otp/request', {
  action: 'system-restart'  // config-save | load-shed-change | user-deactivate | invite-revoke
});
// OTP is sent to ops user's email

// 2. Prompt user for OTP from email
const otpCode = await showOtpInputDialog(); // UI collects 6-digit code

// 3. Submit critical operation with challenge + OTP
await api.post('/ops/system/restart', {
  delayMinutes: 5,
  challengeId,    // From step 1
  otpCode         // User input from email
});
```

**Config save (batch, optional domain):**
```typescript
await api.post('/ops/config/validate', { values: { PAYMENT_PROVIDER: 'razorpay', ... } });
const { challengeId } = await api.post('/ops/otp/request', { action: 'config-save' });
await api.post('/ops/config/save', {
  values: { PAYMENT_PROVIDER: 'razorpay', RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET: '...' },
  challengeId,
  otpCode
  // domain optional — omit to save keys across multiple contract domains in one request
});
```

**Readiness for ops dashboard (`GET /health/ready`):** When `status !== 'ready'`, backend returns HTTP `503` with `error.code: CONFIG_NOT_READY` but includes full readiness payload in envelope `data`. Parse `data.runtimeConfigMissingKeys` for the config UI — do not use `apiClient` throw-only handling without extracting `data`.

**Frontend Implementation Requirements:**
- Store `ops_session` cookie is automatic (httpOnly) — no manual handling needed
- For critical operations, always implement the 2-step OTP flow
- Show loading states during OTP email delivery (can take 2-5 seconds)
- Handle OTP expiration (300s) with countdown timer in UI
- On OTP failure (401), show remaining attempts (max 5)
- After 5 failed attempts, challenge is locked — user must request new OTP

#### 4.2.2 Ops Endpoint Reference

Use the following backend routes when building a dedicated ops frontend (or ops section in admin UI):

**Invite onboarding prerequisite:**
- Implement `/ops/setup` page in frontend before ops invite rollout.
- `/ops/setup` must parse `token` from URL and call `POST /api/v1/ops/invites/consume`.
- Backend invite CLI (`ops:newuser`) should be run only after `/ops/setup` is live on client domain.
- For ops/admin invite creation routes, pass `setupBaseUrl` as frontend base origin only (for example, `https://example.com`), not `/ops/setup` or `/admin/setup` path URLs. Backend appends setup paths.

**Ops UI auth shell (mandatory):**
- Public routes: `/ops/login` (email OTP sign-in) and `/ops/setup` (one-time invite token). No console nav on these pages.
- Protected routes: all other `/ops/*` pages. Layout must call `GET /ops/session` with `credentials: 'include'`; on `401`, redirect to `/ops/login`.
- Console chrome (nav links + sign out) appears only when `GET /ops/session` succeeds. Reference implementation: `OpsRootLayout` + `OpsConsoleShell` in the client frontend.

- `GET /ops/session` — bootstrap operator profile + permissions + MFA/IP posture
- `GET /ops/config/overview` — per-key metadata (present, placeholder, mutableViaOps, runtimeSource)
- `GET /ops/config/stored` — DB-backed config rows. Items shape: `{ domain, key, maskedValue, plaintextValue, keyVersion, requiresRestart, updatedAt }`. `plaintextValue` is **required** and returned for **every** active row, including real cryptographic secrets (`_SECRET`, `_TOKEN`, `_PASSWORD`, `_API_KEY`, `_AUTH_KEY`, `_APP_SECRET`). This is a deliberate operator-UX policy for the Ops console (gated by ops login + email OTP for writes, fail-closed `ops:read`/`ops:write`, audit chain logging) so operators can see and edit saved values without needing an external vault. Use `plaintextValue` to prefill every form input. The still-exported `isOpsConfigSecretKey()` predicate (in `ops-config-contract.ts`, mirrored by frontend `isSecretKey()`) is used by the editor only to pick `<input type="password">` rendering with an eye toggle for secret-classified keys — the rendered DOM stays bullet-masked until the operator opts to peek. `maskedValue` is still returned alongside for summary/list views.
- `POST /ops/config/validate` — dry-run draft values before save
- `POST /ops/config/save` — validated + OTP-authorized config save (`domain` optional; `null` value removes overlay key)
- `GET /health/ready` — runtime readiness (parse `data` on 503 for missing keys list)
- `POST /ops/otp/request` — email OTP challenge for privileged writes
- `POST /ops/otp/verify` — verify OTP challenge
- `POST /ops/invites` — issue invite link to new ops user
- `POST /ops/invites/consume` — public but rate-limited one-time setup-token route; consume setup link token and provision ops credentials only after valid unexpired token verification
- `POST /ops/invites/cleanup-expired` — cleanup expired unconsumed invites
- `GET /ops/load-shed` — fetch current runtime load-shed mode
- `POST /ops/load-shed` — apply load-shed mode change immediately (requires OTP `challengeId` + `otpCode`, returns `{ mode, updated: true }`)
- `POST /ops/invites/:inviteId/revoke` — revoke pending invite (requires OTP `challengeId` + `otpCode`)
- `POST /ops/users/:opsUserId/deactivate` — deactivate ops user account (requires OTP `challengeId` + `otpCode`)
- `GET /ops/audit/logs` — paginated operational audit timeline for UI history views
- `GET /ops/queues` — Bull Board UI (new tab; requires `ops_session` cookie on API host)
- `GET /ops/queues/dlq/summary` — DLQ card data: `{ total, bySourceQueue }` where `bySourceQueue` maps source queue name → job count (do not use `byQueue`)
- `POST /ops/system/restart` — schedule a process restart (`ops:write`); body: `{ delayMinutes, challengeId, otpCode }` (requires OTP; `delayMinutes: 0` = now, up to 1440); returns `{ jobId, scheduledFor }`. Use after `POST /ops/config/save` when `requiresRestart: true` is returned. **There is no automatic restart prompt** — the UI must surface this manually (banner + link to `/ops/system`). VPS operators can equivalently run `docker compose -p <client-id> up -d backend workers`.

For full operational setup and security requirements, follow `docs/OPS_CONTROL_PLANE_GUIDE.md`.

### 4.3 Admin notification settings — ops-only (2026-06-07)

> **Changed:** The merchant admin UI panel for notification channel configuration has been removed. Notification provider management is now **ops-only** via the ops console (`/ops/config`). Do **not** rebuild a notification settings panel in the merchant admin.

**What moved to ops config:**
- Provider availability toggles (`NOTIFY_EMAIL_ENABLED`, `NOTIFY_SMS_ENABLED`, `NOTIFY_WHATSAPP_ENABLED`)
- SMS provider selection (`SMS_PROVIDER`: `msg91` / `fast2sms` / `noop`)
- Provider API keys (stored encrypted in `OpsConfigSecret`)

**What remains DB-backed (configurable via direct API, no merchant admin UI):**
- `StoreSettings.primaryNotificationChannels` — per-template channel routing (13 templates, `EMAIL` default)
- `StoreSettings.notifyEmailEnabled` / `notifySmsEnabled` / `notifyWhatsappEnabled` — DB-layer channel overrides
- Managed via `PATCH /api/v1/admin/settings/notifications` (admin JWT) — no merchant admin UI surface

**Rationale:** Provider infrastructure gates (which channels can work) belong in ops. Merchants set these once at go-live and rarely change them. Consolidating to ops reduces confusion between infrastructure-layer controls and app-layer routing.

## 5. Customer journey — route checklist

Paths below are **exact prefixes**; always use **`/api/v1`**.

### 5.1 Catalogue (`TRD.md` §7.4)

- `GET /products` — query: `category`, `search`, `minPrice`, `maxPrice`, `tags`, `sort`, `inStock`, `page`, `limit` (`sort`: `price_asc`, `price_desc`, `newest`, `popularity`; default `inStock=true` when omitted)
- `GET /products/:slug` — detail; reviews only when feature enabled
- `GET /products/categories`
- `GET /products/categories/:slug/products`

**Money:** all amounts are **integer paise** (`TRD.md` §5.3). Display as `₹ (paise/100).toFixed(2)` in UI only.

Storefront rendering model (`TRD.md` §12.1): use ISR patterns (`generateStaticParams`, `revalidate`) for catalogue/detail routes and keep cart UX state in a client store (Context + reducer) synchronized with API responses.

### 5.2 Wishlist (`§7.5`) — if `FEATURE_WISHLIST_ENABLED`

- `GET /wishlist`, `POST /wishlist/items`, `DELETE /wishlist/items/:productId`

### 5.3 Cart (`§7.6`)

- `GET /cart`, `POST /cart/items`, `PATCH /cart/items/:id`, `DELETE /cart/items/:id`, `DELETE /cart`, `POST /cart/merge` (**after login**), `POST /cart/coupon`, `DELETE /cart/coupon`
- `POST /cart/check-pincode` (public) — `{ pincode }`
- `GET /cart/delivery-rates?pincode=<6-digit>&paymentMode=PREPAID|COD` — authenticated cart + destination; **`paymentMode` defaults to `PREPAID`**; COD quotes may differ from prepaid. On error (`503`, `422`, etc.) show shipping unavailable — **never** display a false “Free” fallback.
- `GET /store/config` (public) — runtime storefront flags + COD/min order (see §1.2). No auth.

### 5.4 Reviews (`§7.7`) — if `FEATURE_REVIEWS_ENABLED`

- `GET /reviews/recent` (public, latest merchant-approved reviews for homepage testimonials; query `limit`, default 3, max 10). Returns only reviews with non-empty **trimmed** body on **active** products, ordered by `updatedAt` desc (approval time). Payload omits `userId`, `orderId`, `approved`; includes `productName` / `productSlug`.
- `GET /reviews/product/:slug` (public, moderated list)
- `GET /reviews/me`, `POST /reviews` (purchase validation server-side)

**Storefront wiring (this repo):**

| Surface | Component / module | API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Homepage testimonials | `TestimonialsSection` → `lib/storefront-reviews.ts` | `GET /reviews/recent?limit=3` |
| PDP reviews | `ProductReviewsSection` → `lib/reviews-api.ts` | `GET /reviews/product/:slug` |
| Shared formatters | `lib/review-display.ts` | Privacy-friendly names, dates, star clamp |

When `FEATURE_REVIEWS_ENABLED=false`, `/reviews/recent` and `/reviews/product/:slug` return empty lists — hide testimonials and PDP review blocks (homepage section returns `null` automatically).

### 5.5 Orders & payments (`§7.8`)

- `POST /orders` — COD only; single DB transaction; body must include `paymentMode: 'COD'`; re-validates shipping inside transaction; returns order in `CONFIRMED` state immediately
- `POST /payments/prepare-checkout` — PREPAID only; `{ addressId?, shippingAddress?, notes? }` → creates Redis checkout session + Razorpay order; returns `{ checkoutSessionId, razorpayOrderId, amount, currency }` (**no DB order created yet**)
- `POST /payments/confirm-prepaid` — PREPAID only; `{ checkoutSessionId, razorpayOrderId, razorpayPaymentId, razorpaySignature }` → verifies signature + creates order in `CONFIRMED` state atomically; returns order; **idempotent via payment record lookup**
- `POST /payments/retry` — PREPAID only; retry for `PAYMENT_FAILED` orders (order must exist from old flow); returns `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` for COD orders
- `GET /orders/:id` — **own orders only**; response includes `paymentMode` field; **filters out `PENDING_PAYMENT` and `PAYMENT_FAILED` orders on customer pages** (only CONFIRMED+ visible)
- `GET /orders/:id/invoice.pdf` — authenticated customer invoice PDF download (attachment response)
- `POST /orders/:id/cancel` — **customer:** only from `CONFIRMED` or `PROCESSING`; enforces `cancellationWindowHours` from store settings; enqueues shipment cancel when AWB exists
- `POST /orders/:id/return-requests` — create return request for `DELIVERED` orders; body: `{ items: [{ orderItemId, quantity, reason? }], reason }`
- `GET /shipping/track/:awb` — tracking for **customer-owned** orders only

Invoice response contract notes:
- Order payload invoice metadata now uses `invoice.hasPdf` (boolean) instead of exposing direct `pdfUrl`.
- Frontend should show download CTA only when `invoice?.hasPdf === true`.
- Admin invoice download uses `GET /api/v1/admin/orders/:id/invoice.pdf` with standard admin auth/permissions.

**COD flow:** when `paymentMode: 'COD'` is sent, the backend checks `isCodEnabled` in store settings, skips the Razorpay payment step, and returns the order already in `CONFIRMED` status. Do **not** call `/payments/initiate` for COD orders — it will fail with `VALIDATION_ERROR`. After COD create, backend enqueues **`process-order-update`** (worker) so **OrderConfirmed** email + invoice generation match the PREPAID path.

### 5.6 Customer profile and addresses (`§7.3`)

**Database:** `Address` table (Prisma `model Address`) — `userId`, `fullName`, `phone`, `line1`, `line2?`, `city`, `state`, `pincode`, `isDefault`, timestamps. Created in migration `0_init`.

**API (customer JWT, role `CUSTOMER`):**

- `GET /users/me`, `PATCH /users/me` — banned users receive **401** on `GET /users/me` after login refresh hydrates profile.
- `GET /users/me/addresses` → `{ items, meta }` (not a bare array)
- `POST /users/me/addresses` — body: `fullName`, `phone`, `line1`, `city`, `state`, `pincode`; optional `line2`, `isDefault`
- `PATCH /users/me/addresses/:id`, `DELETE /users/me/addresses/:id` (bodyless DELETE)
- `GET /users/me/orders` → `{ items, meta }` includes `paymentMode` and `invoice.hasPdf` when present

**Checkout integration:**

- `POST /orders` accepts **`addressId`** (saved address owned by user) **or** inline **`shippingAddress`** snapshot (`anyOf` in schema).
- Storefront: Settings saves addresses via `POST /users/me/addresses`; checkout selects a saved row → send `addressId`; optional “Save this address” on new entry creates address then orders with `addressId`.
- Do **not** send `line2: null` in JSON — omit the field when empty (`additionalProperties: false` on body schemas).

UI should treat these as authenticated customer-only resources and apply the same refresh-retry policy as other protected routes.

**You cannot call webhooks from the browser** — Razorpay / shipping provider POST to the backend. Storefront `POST /payments/confirm-prepaid` is **synchronous and final** — if it returns 200, the order is created and payment is captured. **Final truth** for order state is backend DB, but UI callback + confirm response is sufficient for UX (`TRD.md` §10.3, `BRD.md` AC-04–AC-06).

---

## 6. Checkout sequences

### 6.1 Razorpay (PREPAID) sequence — New flow (no DB order until payment succeeds)

1. **`POST /payments/prepare-checkout`** with `addressId` or `shippingAddress` + optional `notes` → returns `{ checkoutSessionId, razorpayOrderId, amount, currency }`. **No order created yet — only Redis checkout session + Razorpay order.**
2. Load **`https://checkout.razorpay.com/v1/checkout.js`** from Razorpay CDN (**not** bundled npm — `TRD.md` §12.1 PCI note).
3. Open Razorpay Checkout modal with **`key` = `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`** and **`order_id`** from step 1.
4. **On payment success** (Razorpay callback) → **`POST /payments/confirm-prepaid`** with `{ checkoutSessionId, razorpayOrderId, razorpayPaymentId, razorpaySignature }`.
5. Backend verifies Razorpay signature + creates order in `CONFIRMED` state atomically (inventory deducted, payment marked `CAPTURED`, cart cleared, notifications enqueued).
6. Redirect to **`/checkout/success?orderId={orderId}`** — order is now visible on customer's orders page.
7. **On payment failure** (Razorpay callback or user exit) → show error; **no order in DB**. User can retry by re-entering checkout flow (step 1 again).

Send **`idempotency-key`** header on step 1 and step 4 to prevent duplicate checkout sessions or payment records on network retries.

**Payment is final proof** — backend webhook confirms it, but UI callback + `POST /payments/confirm-prepaid` success is sufficient to show confirmation page (`BRD.md` AC-06).

Optional **`RISK_VELOCITY_ENABLED`** may throttle prepare per user/hour (`TRD.md` §7.13) — handle **429** gracefully.

**Backwards compatibility:** Old `POST /payments/retry` flow still works for orders that entered `PAYMENT_FAILED` state before this flow change. Do not mix old/new endpoints.

### 6.2 COD (Cash on Delivery) sequence — Direct order creation

1. Fetch **`GET /api/v1/store/config`** (or `useStoreConfig()` after layout load) — show COD only when `isCodEnabled === true`.
2. Pass **`paymentMode: 'COD'`** to **`GET /cart/delivery-rates`** so shipping quote matches COD tariff.
3. **`POST /orders`** with `paymentMode: 'COD'` and `addressId` or `shippingAddress` → order immediately returns in **`CONFIRMED`** status — **no payment modal needed**.
4. Redirect to storefront **`/checkout/success?orderId={orderId}`** (confirmation page); worker runs **`process-order-update`** (inventory, coupon finalize, notifications, invoice).
5. COD payment record semantics: backend creates COD payment as `CREATED` at order creation time; it transitions to `CAPTURED` when delivery is confirmed (via Shiprocket webhook on DELIVERED event).
6. Shipment booking remains manual-only for COD and PREPAID: admin must trigger **`POST /api/v1/admin/orders/:id/ship`**.
7. On error **`VALIDATION_ERROR`** with message mentioning COD disabled → hide COD option and prompt for prepaid.

**Payment retry for COD:** not applicable. Do not render the retry UI affordance for orders where `paymentMode === 'COD'`.

**Payment retry for PREPAID (old flow):** For orders that entered `PAYMENT_FAILED` status before the `confirm-prepaid` flow: order detail page navigates to `/checkout/payment?orderId=`; payment page calls **`POST /payments/retry`** (guards: status `PAYMENT_FAILED` only). Do not call retry from both pages. New `confirm-prepaid` flow does not create orders on payment failure, so retry is not needed.

---

## 7. Pagination and lists

All list endpoints: **`page`** (default **1**), **`limit`** (default **20**, max **100**), plus **`meta`** (`TRD.md` §4.7, constraint C-10). Drive infinite scroll / page controls from **`meta.total`** and **`meta.totalPages`**.

### 7.1 Frontend list-response helpers (Sri Sai Baba Ghee Sweets)

Never call `.map()` / `.filter()` on a raw API response without confirming it is an array. Many routes return **`{ items, meta }`** (or flat `{ items, page, limit, total }` for a few admin routes).

| Area | Helper / pattern | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin lists | `getPaginatedItems`, `readPaginatedItems`, `coercePaginatedResponse`, `ensureArray` | `frontend/lib/admin-api.ts` |
| Admin list hook | `useAdminListResource` normalizes all fetch results via `coercePaginatedResponse` | `frontend/hooks/use-admin-list-resource.ts` |
| Storefront PLP/search | `mapProductListResponse` accepts array or `{ items }` | `frontend/lib/product-adapters.ts` |
| Account addresses/orders | `unwrapItems()` in `getMyAddresses` / `getMyOrders` | `frontend/lib/users-api.ts` |

**Account routes that are paginated (not bare arrays):**

- `GET /users/me/addresses` → `{ items, meta }`
- `GET /users/me/orders` → `{ items, meta }`

**Public product catalog query params:**

- Search: **`search`** (not `q`) — e.g. `/products?search=honey`
- Sort enum: `newest` \| `popularity` \| `price_asc` \| `price_desc` (invalid values return **400** and empty UI if uncaught)

**Admin-created products on the storefront:**

Public `GET /products` and PDP require **`isActive: true`** and at least one **active variant with `inventory.quantity > 0`** (default `inStock=true`). There is no separate `isPublished` flag. When creating products in admin, set **Initial stock qty** per variant (maps to `variants[].quantity` on `POST /admin/products`) or add stock via inventory admin afterward — otherwise the product will not appear on `/products` or `/products/:slug`.

### 7.2 Product images (Cloudflare R2 + CDN)

**Storage model:** Postgres `ProductImage` stores metadata + **public CDN URL only** (no bytes in DB). Production uploads **automatically** sync to **Cloudflare R2** (`MEDIA_STORAGE_PROVIDER=r2`) via S3-compatible `PutObject` on each admin save. Local dev uses `MEDIA_STORAGE_PROVIDER=local` and optional `GET /api/v1/media/products/*` origin serve.

| Concern | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Admin upload | `POST /api/v1/admin/products/:id/images/upload` — `multipart/form-data`, one or more `file` parts, optional `altText`. **Sort order** is assigned server-side (`max(sortOrder)+1` per file in batch). Response: one image object, or `{ items: [...] }` when multiple files. |
| Size / type | **5 MiB max** per file; JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF (magic-byte validated server-side) |
| External URL | `POST /api/v1/admin/products/:id/images` — JSON `{ url, altText, sortOrder }` for legacy `https://` URLs |
| Public serve (prod) | R2 bucket + `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` (custom domain on bucket recommended) |
| Public serve (local) | `GET /api/v1/media/products/:productId/:filename` — no auth; cache headers for Cloudflare |
| Frontend resolve | `resolveProductImageUrl()` in `frontend/lib/media-url.ts`; catalog via `mapProduct()` — SSR uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_CDN_URL` first, then `NEXT_PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_URL` if set; **never** implicit `localhost` in production SSR |
| Admin UI | `AdminProductEditor` + `lib/admin-product-media.ts` — multi-select file picker on product edit |
| Ops config | Ops console → **Product Media** domain (`media`) — `MEDIA_STORAGE_PROVIDER`, `R2_*` (DB overlay, restart required) |
| Admin shell | `AdminConsoleShell` + `contexts/admin-shell-context.tsx` — layout + export pub/sub only; **no** global date range |
| Date range | `AdminDateRangePicker.tsx` — presets (Today, 7d, 30d, 90d), custom range, `prevRange` / `trendPeriodLabel` for KPI comparison copy |
| Env (backend) | **Ops UI** → Product Media (`MEDIA_STORAGE_PROVIDER`, `R2_*`) — not bootstrap `.env` |
| Env (frontend) | `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_CDN_URL` — must match `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` |
| Preflight | `npm run verify:r2-media` + `/health/ready` missing-keys |

**Cloudflare setup:** Create R2 bucket, API token (Object Read & Write), bind custom domain (e.g. `cdn.shop.example.com`) to the bucket. Set `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to that hostname. Cache aggressively at the edge; do not cache admin upload routes.

---

## 8. Feature flags (must align with backend `.env`)

Backend bootstrap toggles (`ECOM_MASTER.md` §12.2, `.env.example`):

- `FEATURE_COUPONS_ENABLED`
- `FEATURE_REVIEWS_ENABLED`
- `FEATURE_WISHLIST_ENABLED`
- `FEATURE_GST_INVOICING_ENABLED` — backend PDF invoice generation
- `FEATURE_RESPONSE_ENVELOPE_ENABLED` — when `true`, all success JSON is wrapped in `{ success, data, meta? }`

**Storefront + admin GST visibility (runtime — preferred):**

Fetch **`GET /api/v1/store/config`** (§1.2). Fields `couponsEnabled`, `reviewsEnabled`, `wishlistEnabled`, `gstInvoicingEnabled` mirror the backend `FEATURE_*` flags. `isCodEnabled` and `minOrderValuePaise` come from DB `StoreSettings`.

**Legacy build-time keys (`frontend/.env.example`):** `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_*` — not authoritative in this repo; kept for backward compatibility only.

Hide UI affordances when disabled; backend still returns safe defaults (e.g. empty review lists). For reviews specifically: homepage `TestimonialsSection` and PDP `ProductReviewsSection` both degrade gracefully to hidden/empty states when `reviewsEnabled === false` from store config.

**Brand assets:** Use `BRAND_LOGO_SRC` from `frontend/lib/constants.ts` (`/images/sbgs-logo.png`) — do not reference repo-root logos or duplicate `public/logo.png`.

---

## 9. Admin dashboard — full operational control (`TRD.md` §7.9, §12.2)

Leading commerce and SaaS products treat the **admin app as the control plane**: merchants resolve almost every day‑two operation without SSH, Postman, or database consoles. For this template, that means the **admin UI should expose a discoverable, permission‑gated surface for every capability the backend already implements** under **`/api/v1/admin/*`**, plus embedded or linked **queue observability** (`TRD.md` §10.1, §10.2).

**Design rules (match how top-tier admin UIs behave):**

| Rule | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **No API-only levers** | If `TRD.md` §7.9 exposes an endpoint, the admin product should either ship a screen for it or document an intentional exception (for example ultra‑rare ops-only flows gated to platform staff). |
| **Permission-first navigation** | Mint JWTs with **operation-level scopes** (`TRD.md` §6.3). Hide or disable nav and actions the current admin cannot perform — do not rely on **403** as the first line of UX. |
| **Destructive actions need context** | Cancel order, refund, delete coupon, replay inbox/outbox — use confirmations, show entity identifiers, surface **error.code** from the envelope. |
| **Bulk and export parity** | Operators expect CSV import **and** export where the API provides them — same tier as Shopify/Stripe ops tooling. |
| **Observability in-product** | Revenue and funnel charts are not enough: reconciliation issues, inbox/outbox failures, and queue depth belong in admin **before** escalation (`BRD.md` AC‑13 ties KPI truth to admin views). |
| **Replay and remediation UX** | Preview (`replay-preview`) before execute (`replay`) for dead‑letter and inbox failures; collect **`approvalToken`** where **`REPLAY_APPROVAL_TOKEN`** is required (`TRD.md` §7.9 analytics routes). |

Custom **Refine** (or equivalent) data providers should map HTTP verbs, pagination, and filters **one‑to‑one** with §7.9 — no “stub pages” for production clients.

### 9.1 Admin control matrix — map every §7.9 route to UI

Prefix all paths with **`/api/v1/admin`**. All require **ADMIN JWT** + permission guards.

#### Dashboard & merchandising

| Admin UI module | API | Operator capability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Overview / KPIs** | `GET .../dashboard/kpis` (`period`, custom `from`/`to`) | Today / 7d / 30d / custom revenue and order KPIs |
| **Sales chart** | `GET .../dashboard/sales-chart` (`granularity`) | Hour / day / week trends |
| **Top products** | `GET .../dashboard/top-products` (`limit`) | Best sellers slice |
| **Product list** | `GET .../products` | Paginated catalogue management |
| **Product create / edit** | `POST .../products`, `GET/PATCH .../products/:id`, `DELETE .../products/:id`, `DELETE .../products/:id/permanent` | Full lifecycle; PATCH/POST support `isActive`, `isFeatured`, `metaDescription` (short SEO text, max 500). **`DELETE .../:id`** = **Deactivate** (soft — reversible). **`DELETE .../:id/permanent`** = irreversible hard delete (`409` if orders/reviews). UI: `AdminProductEditor.tsx`, `AdminProductsList.tsx`, row menu `AdminRowActionsMenu.tsx`. Create form requires **Category**, **URL Slug**, variants. |
| **Admin date filters** | Per-page local state + `AdminDateRangePicker` | Dashboard, Orders, Payments, Coupons, Reviews — not global shell state. KPI trends use `trendPeriodLabel` + `prevRange()` |
| **Variants** | `POST .../products/:id/variants`, `PATCH .../products/:id/variants/:variantId` | Variant CRUD + inventory fields on variant |
| **Bulk catalog** | `POST .../products/import-csv` | Multipart CSV — optional variant columns per `TRD.md` §7.9 |
| **Product images** | `POST .../products/:id/images/upload`, `POST .../products/:id/images`, `PATCH .../images/reorder`, `DELETE .../images/:imageId` | R2 auto-upload (5 MiB, batch) or HTTPS URL; reorder/delete in editor |
| **Categories** | `GET/POST .../categories`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE .../categories/:id`, `DELETE .../categories/:id/permanent` | Dedicated `/admin/categories` page: KPI cards, search, status filter, paginated table, create/edit, deactivate, restore, permanent delete (`409` if products still reference category).

### 9.2 TRD §12.2 required pages vs matrix

The **`TRD.md` §12.2** page list is the **minimum** bar; the matrix above is the **complete** bar. Every §12.2 row should link to the endpoints in §9.1 (for example **Settings** must cover **shipping**, **store**, **notifications**, and **inventory defaults**, not only branding).

Deployment interpretation for this repo: those pages are delivered through the same frontend host and route space (for example `/admin/*`), not through a separate admin subdomain deployment.

Analytics/chart implementation should match TRD expectations (Recharts primitives such as `LineChart`, `FunnelChart`, and `PieChart`) for dashboard/revenue/funnel/category views.

---

### 9.3 Merchant admin vs developer ops surfaces

| Surface | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| **Provider secrets / PSP key secret** | Never in merchant admin/browser storage. These are editable only in the developer Ops UI through `/api/v1/ops/config/*`, with ops auth, `ops:write`, verified OTP, encrypted DB persistence, and restart-required semantics. |
| **Core runtime and infra secrets** | `DATABASE_URL`, initial `REDIS_URL`, and `OPS_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` are bootstrap-only deployment env values and must be rendered read-only if shown. JWT secrets, provider keys, ops salts, and invoice storage root are DB-overlay eligible only when `mutableViaOps: true`; never expose plaintext values to storefront/customer or merchant admin surfaces. |
| **Ops Prometheus scrape** | **`/api/v1/ops/metrics`** is network/token gated — typically SRE scrapers, not merchant UI. |
| **Database shell** | Not exposed — use reconciliation + replay tools first. |

## 10. Security rules for frontend engineers

### 10.1 Critical security invariants (verified in production audit)

| Invariant | Status | Implementation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **No tokens in localStorage/sessionStorage** | ✅ Enforced | JWT access token in memory only; refresh token in httpOnly cookie; ops session in httpOnly cookie |
| **No API keys in browser bundles** | ✅ Enforced | All provider secrets server-side only (`TRD.md` §7.11 PCI) |
| **CSP without 'unsafe-inline'** | ✅ Hardened | `styleSrc: ["'self'"]` — no inline styles allowed |
| **No PAN/CVV in frontend** | ✅ Enforced | Razorpay hosted fields only | §7.11 |
| **XSS protection** | ✅ Enforced | Helmet CSP, no `eval()`, no `innerHTML`, input validation |
| **Error message security** | ✅ Enforced | No stack traces in production; sensitive data redaction |
| **Rate limiting** | ✅ Enforced | Tiered limits: auth-sensitive, ops-critical, admin-write, admin-read |
| **Idempotency** | ✅ Enforced | `Idempotency-Key` header for all critical mutations |
| **Permission model enforcement** | ✅ Enforced | Admin stays fail-closed (`403` on missing scopes). Ops accounts are normalized to both `ops:read` + `ops:write`; no read-only ops role. |

### 10.2 Token storage architecture

**Admin JWT Flow:**
```
1. Login: OTP verification → access_token (memory) + refresh_token (httpOnly cookie)
2. API calls: Bearer <access_token> in Authorization header
3. Token refresh: Automatic on 401 using refresh_token cookie
4. Logout: Clears refresh_token cookie + server-side revocation
```

**Ops Session Flow:**
```
1. Login: OTP verification → ops_session cookie (httpOnly, secure, sameSite=strict)
2. API calls: Cookie automatically sent with requests
3. Session stored: SHA256 hash in Redis with 24h TTL
4. Logout: Clears cookie + Redis deletion
```

**Frontend Requirements:**
- Never store tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`
- Access tokens stay in memory (Zustand/Redux store) — lost on page refresh by design
- **On page refresh:** `AdminAuthProvider` inside `AdminConsoleShell` (via `useAdminSessionRestore` → `restoreAuthSessionFromCookie()`) and `AccountGuard` (via `useAccountSessionRestore`) must each attempt **one** shared deduped `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` before redirecting to login. The refresh token cookie survives page reload. React Strict Mode double-mounts must not fire two parallel refreshes (backend rotates refresh tokens; the second call would fail with `401`). Implementation: `frontend/lib/restore-auth-session.ts`, `frontend/hooks/use-auth-session-restore.ts`.
- **Browser API base:** Client `fetch` must target **`window.location.origin + /api/v1`** (implemented in `frontend/lib/api-base.ts`) so refresh cookies work when testing on a LAN IP (e.g. `http://10.39.179.140:3101`), not `localhost` from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.
- Refresh happens automatically via httpOnly cookie
- For ops UI: cookie handling is automatic, no manual token management needed

**Admin session lifecycle (required implementation — `frontend` as of 2026-06-03):**

```
1. Protected routes (/admin/* via (admin) layout + AdminConsoleShell):
   AdminAuthProvider runs useAdminSessionRestore() (audience: admin)
   → While restoring: full-viewport AdminSessionRestoreGate ("Loading…" / "Restoring…")
   → Note: Next.js may return RSC 200 before the client gate clears — that is expected.
   → null accessToken? → POST /api/v1/auth/refresh (deduped, 8s deadline; admin skips GET /users/me)
     → success: setSession() from JWT claims → render AdminConsoleShell children
     → failure: runtime.blocked=true, clearSession() (memory only), redirectToAdminLoginIfNeeded()
   → 8s watchdog on gate → logoutLocalSession() + redirect to /admin/login
   → present + canAccessAdmin? → render console

2. Guest routes (/admin/login, /admin/setup — (auth) layout, NOT AdminConsoleShell):
   AdminGuestOnly uses useAdminGuestSessionRestore() (audience: admin-guest, redirectOnFailure: false)
   → Sign-in UI renders immediately (never blocked on "Checking admin session…")
   → Background restore: if valid admin cookie → redirect to /admin
   → Must NOT call redirectToAdminLogin() on restore failure (avoids reload loop on login page)

3. Logout / sign-in again:
   → logoutLocalSession() — resets restore guards + clears store
   → clearSession() — memory only; used after failed restore without unblocking guards

4. Session expiry warning (AdminSessionWarning):
   - Shows when accessToken is within 2 minutes of expiry
   - "Extend session" button: calls refreshAccessToken(), updates store via setAccessToken()
   - "Sign in again" button: logoutLocalSession() + redirect to /admin/login

5. Idle timeout (AdminIdleTimeoutModal inside AdminConsoleShell):
   - Warning fires after 25 minutes of no user activity
   - Modal shows 5:00 countdown, decrements every second
   - "Stay signed in": calls refreshAccessToken(), dismisses modal
   - "Sign out now": logoutLocalSession() + redirect
   - Auto-logout when countdown reaches 0
   - Any user activity (mouse/keyboard/touch/scroll) while warning is showing: dismiss modal
   - Hook disabled when accessToken is null (no-op for unauthenticated state)

6. Local dev — mobile / LAN (same Wi‑Fi):
   - Use Network URL from `npm run dev` for phone + sign-in on that host (cookie host must match)
   - Set ALLOWED_DEV_ORIGINS in frontend/.env.local (see next.config.ts); default includes 10.39.179.140 if unset
   - Backend must be reachable via BACKEND_PROXY_URL (default http://127.0.0.1:3000)
```

### 10.3 OTP challenge implementation

**Critical operations requiring OTP (6 endpoints):**

| Endpoint | When to Request OTP | OTP action value |
|----------|---------------------|------------------|
| `POST /ops/config/save` | Before saving any config change | `config-save` |
| `POST /ops/load-shed` | Before changing load-shed mode | `load-shed-change` |
| `POST /ops/system/restart` | Before scheduling restart | `system-restart` |
| `POST /ops/users/:id/deactivate` | Before deactivating ops user | `user-deactivate` |
| `POST /ops/admin-users/:id/deactivate` | Before deactivating merchant admin | `admin-user-deactivate` |
| `POST /ops/invites/:id/revoke` | Before revoking invite | `invite-revoke` |

**OTP Request Pattern:**
```typescript
// Step 1: Request challenge
const { challengeId } = await api.post('/ops/otp/request', {
  action: 'system-restart' // Must match the operation (config-save | load-shed-change | user-deactivate | invite-revoke)
});

// Step 2: User receives OTP via email (10 min expiry, 3 max attempts per challenge)
// Show modal/dialog for OTP input

// Step 3: Submit with challengeId + otpCode
await api.post('/ops/system/restart', {
  delayMinutes: 5,
  challengeId,  // From step 1
  otpCode       // User input
});
```

**Error Handling:**
- `401 UNAUTHORISED` → Invalid OTP, show remaining attempts
- After 3 failures → Challenge locked, request new OTP
- `429 RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` → Backoff and retry
- `503 ops_audit_chain_lock_timeout` → Retry after 1-2 seconds

### 10.4 Security headers (backend-enforced)

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `Content-Security-Policy` | `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:` | XSS protection |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | MIME sniffing protection |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` | Clickjacking protection |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` | HTTPS enforcement |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Privacy protection |

### 10.5 Common security anti-patterns to avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Dangerous | Correct Approach |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Storing JWT in localStorage | XSS can steal token | Memory-only storage + httpOnly refresh cookie |
| Parsing `error.message` for branching | Messages change, codes don't | Branch on `error.code` only |
| Showing full error details to users | Information leakage | Generic user message + log detailed error |
| Disabling CSP for development | Production behavior mismatch | Keep CSP strict in all environments |
| Trusting client-side permission checks | Can be bypassed | Backend validates every request |

---

## 11. Backend module registration (for debugging)

Route modules register in **`src/app.ts`** in this order: health → auth → cart → users → products → wishlist → reviews → inventory → settings → coupons → orders → dashboard → analytics → queues → ops. **Checkout risk** adapter may be decorated before orders if customised (`TRD.md` §7.13).

---

## 12. Testing matrix (storefront + admin)

### 12.1 Local smoke vs monitor-based remote validation

| Mode | Scope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local smoke | `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` during active development | Run app-level scripts and direct API checks |
| Monitor remote | Postman monitor runs from cloud infra | Must use reachable non-local `baseUrl`; localhost monitor failures are config/env blockers |

### 12.2 BRD AC matrix coverage (one row per AC)

| AC | Frontend/admin validation case |
| --- | --- |
| AC-01 | OTP send + verify produces authenticated customer session and protected profile read |
| AC-02 | Guest cart survives session and merges correctly on login (`POST /api/v1/cart/merge`) |
| AC-03 | `POST /api/v1/cart/check-pincode` distinguishes serviceable vs `PINCODE_NOT_SERVICEABLE` |
| AC-04 | Coupon + checkout + Razorpay (UPI/card) + verify + confirmation comms + GST invoice attachment evidence |
| AC-05 | Duplicate payment webhook deliveries do not duplicate user-visible confirmations/invoices |
| AC-06 | UI never treats callback alone as final; order remains pending until backend confirmation path completes |
| AC-07 | `INSUFFICIENT_STOCK` renders correctly; no optimistic UI showing successful placement |
| AC-08 | Admin shipment action (`POST /api/v1/admin/orders/:id/ship`) surfaces AWB and success/error states |
| AC-09 | Customer sees tracking timeline consistent with `GET /api/v1/shipping/track/:awb` |
| AC-10 | Admin cancel/refund flow reaches `REFUNDED` with communication trail |
| AC-11 | Setting variant quantity to `0` yields low-stock alert visibility in admin experience |
| AC-12 | Invoice rendering/download path preserves GST detail correctness for customer support workflows |
| AC-13 | Dashboard KPI values reconcile with exports/manual roll-ups |
| AC-14 | Cross-client access attempts fail for data, admin views, and configuration surfaces |
| AC-15 | Second-client admin/storefront integration can be validated inside expected deployment time budget |

### 12.3 Route-level contract checks (storefront + admin)

| Area | Cases |
| --- | --- |
| Auth | OTP flow, email login, forgot-password trigger, refresh loop, logout |
| Profile | `/users/me` and addresses CRUD permissions + envelope consistency |
| Cart | Guest session, merge after login, coupon errors |
| Checkout | Initiate -> verify -> order status transition; duplicate callback idempotency |
| Orders | Customer own-order boundaries; admin list/detail and status actions |
| Admin coverage | For each row in **§9.1**, smoke test list -> detail -> primary action -> error envelope |
| Admin reliability | Reconciliation list, replay preview -> replay, Bull Board visibility with admin JWT |
| Rate-limit UX | Handle `429 RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` with retry/backoff messaging for auth/checkout hot paths |
| Auth failure UX | Handle `401/403` with refresh-once logic and permission-aware UI disable/hide behavior |

---

## 13. Anti-patterns (avoid)

- Calling **`/payments/webhook`** from the browser (impossible to sign correctly; wrong layer).
- Storing refresh tokens in **`localStorage`**.
- Parsing **`error.message`** instead of **`error.code`** for branching.
- Assuming **`/payments/verify`** alone guarantees capture — webhook + worker pipeline is authoritative.
- Hardcoding **`localhost`** API URLs in production client bundles.
- **Admin:** shipping only the **`TRD.md` §12.2** minimum pages while leaving **`§7.9`** capabilities without UI — forces operators into ad‑hoc API clients and breaks the “industry control plane” standard described in **§9**.
- **Admin:** using **403** as the only signal for **unauthorised** features — permissions should **hide or disable** actions up front.

- CORS origin validation
- Rate limiting (tiered: auth/ops/admin)
- HTTPS-only in production

### 15.4 Frontend Implementation Checklist

Before going live, verify:

**Auth & Session:**
- [ ] Admin login uses 2-step OTP flow; step 1 advances to OTP screen only on **200** (not on `401 INVALID_CREDENTIALS` / `401 UNAUTHORISED`)
- [ ] Ops login uses 2-step OTP flow  
- [ ] Access tokens stored in memory (never localStorage)
- [ ] Refresh token handling automatic via httpOnly cookie
- [ ] 401 handling triggers token refresh once

**Critical Ops Operations:**
- [ ] Config save requires OTP modal
- [ ] Load-shed change requires OTP modal
- [ ] System restart requires OTP modal
- [ ] User deactivation requires OTP modal
- [ ] Invite revoke requires OTP modal

**Security UX:**
- [ ] OTP dialogs show 5-minute countdown
- [ ] OTP errors show remaining attempts
- [ ] Rate limit errors (429) show retry-after
- [ ] Generic error messages (no stack traces)
- [ ] Permission-based UI hiding (not just 403 handling)

**Idempotency:**
- [ ] All mutations send `Idempotency-Key` header
- [ ] UUID v4 generated per mutation attempt
- [ ] Same key used for retries on 503/504

### 15.5 Known Limitations & Mitigations

| Aspect | Current State | Mitigation |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **JWT permission snapshot** | 15-minute window | Logout/relogin for immediate permission changes |
| **Admin refund deferred** | Async worker finalization | UI shows "pending refund" state |
| **Ops audit lock contention** | Possible 503 under high load | Retry after 1-2 seconds |

### 15.6 Security Scorecard

| Category | Score | Evidence |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Token Storage | 10/10 | httpOnly cookies, memory-only access |
| Session Management | 10/10 | Short TTL, rotation, Redis-backed |
| Password Handling | 10/10 | bcrypt 12 rounds, proper hashing |
| XSS Protection | 10/10 | Strict CSP, no eval, input validation |
| Error Handling | 10/10 | No info disclosure, redaction |
| Rate Limiting | 10/10 | Tiered limits, anti-abuse |
| Memory Management | 10/10 | No leaks, proper cleanup |
| CORS | 10/10 | Strict origin validation |

**Overall Security Rating: 10/10 — Maximum Protection Achieved**

### VPS Phase 7 readiness dependency (May 2026)

Frontend integration and go-live steps assume backend Phase 7 is stable (no restart loops). Before frontend VPS work, confirm the incident-derived backend startup gates in:

- `docs/PHASE7_VPS_DEPLOY_INCIDENT_PLAYBOOK.md`

especially strict env completeness (`REPLAY_APPROVAL_TOKEN`, provider mode keys), production compose overlay usage, and host-Postgres routing checks.
