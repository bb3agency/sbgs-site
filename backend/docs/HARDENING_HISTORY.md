**Order, payment, coupon, shipping, and storefront integration hardening — June 10, 2026 (pass 2):**

Root cause / gaps addressed: (1) Storefront feature flags and COD/min-order were build-time or admin-only — toggling backend `FEATURE_*` or DB settings did not reach customer UI without redeploy. (2) Coupon usage limits ignored in-flight checkout orders in `PAYMENT_FAILED`, allowing reuse before worker finalization. (3) Guest coupon Redis increment failures were fail-open. (4) Stale invalid coupons remained on cart reads. (5) Checkout showed static/free shipping while COD vs PREPAID rates differ. (6) `createOrder` shipping TOCTOU vs cart preview. (7) Cancel paths did not enqueue provider shipment cancel or guard COD inventory restore before worker deduction. (8) `payment.captured` webhook + `PAYMENT_FAILED` order was rejected by worker CAS. (9) `retryPayment` did not restore cart reservations for `PAYMENT_FAILED` / `PENDING_PAYMENT`. (10) Reconciliation auto-heal for refunds did not restore inventory; stale abandoned checkouts did not release coupon links; `ORDER_SHIPPED_WITHOUT_SHIPMENT` was incorrectly in default auto-heal set. (11) COD worker failure left coupon reservations and sent no cancel notifications. (12) Frontend cancel UI allowed `PENDING_PAYMENT`; retry payment ran twice; invoice UI used build-time GST flag instead of `invoice.hasPdf`.

**Backend — orders, payments, coupons, workers:**
- **`GET /api/v1/store/config` (public):** Returns `isCodEnabled`, `minOrderValuePaise`, `mobileOtpSignupEnabled`, and runtime mirrors of `FEATURE_COUPONS_ENABLED`, `FEATURE_REVIEWS_ENABLED`, `FEATURE_WISHLIST_ENABLED`, `FEATURE_GST_INVOICING_ENABLED`. No auth; safe for RSC ISR.
- **Coupon reservation semantics (`coupon-usage.ts`):** `COUPON_RESERVED_ORDER_STATUSES` = `PENDING_PAYMENT` + `PAYMENT_FAILED`. Shared helpers: `assertCouponWithinUsageLimits`, `finalizeCouponUsageForOrder`, `releaseCouponUsageForOrder`, `clearUnfinalizedCouponLinks`.
- **Guest coupon Redis (`cart.service.ts`):** Increment failure is fail-closed (throws — does not silently allow over-limit apply).
- **Stale coupon on cart read:** `stripInvalidCouponFromCart` removes expired/over-limit/disabled coupons when cart is loaded.
- **Shipping:** `GET /cart/delivery-rates?pincode=&paymentMode=PREPAID|COD` returns mode-specific quotes; `createOrder` re-quotes inside the transaction (TOCTOU guard). Cancel paths enqueue **`cancel-shipment`** on `shipping` queue (`jobId: cancel-shipment:<orderId>`). `shipping.worker.ts` handles `cancel-shipment` + phase-3 compensating Delhivery cancel when booking fails after partial provider state.
- **`payment.captured` + `PAYMENT_FAILED`:** `order-processing.worker.ts` CAS accepts both statuses for prepaid confirmation; reconciliation enqueues `process-order-update` for the same mismatch.
- **`retryPayment`:** Calls `restoreCheckoutReservationsForOrder` for `PAYMENT_FAILED` and `PENDING_PAYMENT` before re-initiating Razorpay.
- **COD coupon finalize:** `createOrder` finalizes coupon usage inside the COD DB transaction (same reservation rules as prepaid post-capture).
- **COD cancel inventory race (`restore-inventory-on-cancel.ts`):** Inventory restored on cancel only after `COD_ORDER_CREATED` appears in order status history (worker has deducted stock).
- **Payment failed path:** Always `releaseReservationsForOrder`; customer notified on email **or** phone when available.
- **COD worker failure:** `handleCodSideEffectsFailure` releases coupon usage, restores reservations, cancels order, sends cancel notifications.
- **Reconciliation defaults (`reconciliation.worker.ts`):** Default auto-heal set (when env unset) = `PAYMENT_CAPTURED_ORDER_NOT_CONFIRMED`, `REFUNDED_STATUS_MISMATCH`, `STALE_PENDING_PAYMENT` — **not** `ORDER_SHIPPED_WITHOUT_SHIPMENT` (manual review; false positives auto-resolved when shipment row exists). Stale `PAYMENT_FAILED` (>30 min, no captured payment) cancels via same handler when `STALE_PENDING_PAYMENT` is enabled; records issue type `STALE_PAYMENT_FAILED`. `REFUNDED_STATUS_MISMATCH` heal restores inventory (when prior status was `CONFIRMED`/`PROCESSING`), releases coupon usage, clears unfinalized coupon links.
- **Cancel flows:** Inventory restore guard, coupon release, shipment cancel enqueue on customer/admin cancel.
- **Admin item edits:** `adminUpdateOrderItems` syncs inventory when order is `CONFIRMED`.

**Frontend:**
- **`StoreConfigProvider` + `lib/storefront-settings.ts`:** Storefront layout fetches `GET /store/config` (ISR 60s server-side; client helper for admin GST panels). Fail-closed when fetch fails (`configAvailable: false` blocks checkout).
- **Checkout (`CheckoutForm.tsx`):** Live shipping via `getDeliveryRates(pincode, token, paymentMode)`; errors surface as unavailable — no false “Free” fallback.
- **Cancel UI:** Account order detail — cancel only when status is `CONFIRMED` or `PROCESSING` (not `PENDING_PAYMENT`).
- **Retry payment:** Order detail navigates to payment page only; `/checkout/payment` calls `retryPayment` once with status guard (`PENDING_PAYMENT` / `PAYMENT_FAILED`, not COD).
- **Invoice UI:** Download CTA when `order.invoice?.hasPdf === true` only (not build-time GST flag).
- **Admin GST:** `StoreSettingsPanel` + `AdminProductEditor` use runtime `gstInvoicingEnabled` from `/store/config`.
- **Admin nav:** Coupons + Reviews always visible (moderation surfaces even when storefront modules are off).
- **Invoice download errors:** `ApiError` parsing in `orders-api.ts` and `AdminOrderFulfillmentPanel.tsx`.

**Tests added/updated:** `order-processing.worker.test.ts`, `reconciliation.worker.test.ts`, `orders.service.cod.test.ts`, `orders.service.cancel-notifications.test.ts`, `orders.service.admin-update-items.test.ts`, `coupon-usage.test.ts`, `cart.service.apply-coupon.guest-redis.test.ts`, `restore-inventory-on-cancel.test.ts`, `storefront-settings.test.ts`, `admin-nav-config.test.ts`.

**CI reliability (2026-06-10 pass 2):** Backend `npx vitest run` — **1012/1012**; backend e2e **16/16**; `tsc --noEmit` clean; frontend Vitest **114/114**; `npm run build` clean.

**Intentionally deferred (documented, not claimed fixed):**
- `retryPayment` reservation upsert does not re-validate live stock availability before restore.
- `adminUpdateOrderItems` does not recalculate coupon/discount totals after line changes.
- No dedicated unit tests yet for `release-reservations.ts` or full `cancel-shipment` / shipping phase-3 paths.

**Affects:** `orders.service.ts`, `cart.service.ts`, `coupon-usage.ts`, `restore-inventory-on-cancel.ts`, `release-reservations.ts`, `order-processing.worker.ts`, `reconciliation.worker.ts`, `shipping.worker.ts`, `settings.service.ts`, `settings.routes.ts`, `CheckoutForm.tsx`, `cart-api.ts`, `orders-api.ts`, `storefront-settings.ts`, `StoreConfigProvider.tsx`, admin GST panels, account/checkout pages, integration docs listed in this pass.

**Production readiness pass — logo assets, boot guards, notification provider tracking, CI gates — June 10, 2026:**

Root cause / gaps addressed: (1) Brand logo lived at repo root and in duplicate `public/logo.png` paths with inconsistent references. (2) Missing `STOREFRONT_URL` in production-like profiles could still boot and send password-reset emails with `localhost` links (`auth.service.ts` fallback). (3) SSR product image resolution could embed `localhost` when `NEXT_PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_URL` was unset. (4) `notifications.worker.ts` declared `onProviderSuccess` / `onProviderFailure` but never called them — systematic provider failure counters and alerts were dead code. (5) Stale `dist/src/modules` caused admin policy registry integrity test to fail for `DELETE /api/v1/admin/categories/:id/permanent`. (6) BullMQ plugin unit test mock lacked `.on()` after `guardRedisDuplicate` wiring. (7) Settings COD route test fixture omitted `mobileOtpSignupEnabled`, failing Fastify response validation.

Changes applied:
- **Brand logo:** Canonical asset at `frontend/public/images/sbgs-logo.png`; constant `BRAND_LOGO_SRC` in `frontend/lib/constants.ts`; all header/admin shell/mobile nav references updated; removed repo-root and `public/logo.png` duplicates.
- **Backend boot guard:** `app.config.ts` fail-fast when `STOREFRONT_URL` is missing or placeholder in production-like profiles (password-reset email safety).
- **Frontend SSR images:** `media-url.ts` — SSR builds absolute URLs only when `NEXT_PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_URL` is explicitly set; never falls back to `localhost` in production SSR HTML.
- **Frontend env docs:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_GST_INVOICING_ENABLED` documented in `frontend/.env.example` and `.env.production.example` (admin `StoreSettingsPanel` GSTIN/FSSAI field visibility).
- **Notifications worker:** Wired `onProviderSuccess` / `onProviderFailure` into all email, SMS, and WhatsApp send paths (direct + primary-channel dispatch) for provider failure counting and `sendNotificationFailureAlert` on systematic outages.
- **Redis TypeScript:** `redis-connection.ts` uses `WeakSet` for guarded-client tracking; `guardRedisDuplicate` generic aligned with ioredis duplicate return type; worker boot paths explicitly typed `IORedis`.
- **Admin policy registry validation:** Static route record for `DELETE /api/v1/admin/categories/:id/permanent` so stale `dist/` scans pass until next production build.
- **Test / CI fixes:** `bullmq.plugin.test.ts` duplicate mock `.on()`; `settings.routes.test.ts` COD fixture fields; frontend ESLint unused-import cleanup; removed unreferenced `TrustStrip.tsx` stub.
- **CI reliability (2026-06-10):** Backend `npx vitest run` — **935/935**; `tsc --noEmit` clean; frontend `npm run lint` clean; `npm run build` clean.

**Affects:** `app.config.ts`, `notifications.worker.ts`, `redis-connection.ts`, `queues/workers/index.ts`, `frontend/lib/constants.ts`, `frontend/lib/media-url.ts`, `frontend/.env.example`, `frontend/.env.production.example`, `admin-policy-registry.validation.ts`, test fixtures listed above, `Header.tsx`, `MobileNav.tsx`, `AdminConsoleShell.tsx`.

**Redis connection hardening, bodyless DELETE schemas, and admin policy registry — June 9, 2026:**

Root cause: Transient Redis network blips (`ECONNRESET`, `ECONNREFUSED`) on Docker/Windows produced unhandled `[ioredis] error event` spam because BullMQ and pub/sub paths call `duplicate()` without attaching listeners. Separately, several DELETE routes declared an empty JSON `body` schema; Fastify rejected bodyless DELETE requests with `VALIDATION_ERROR` (coupon soft-delete/restore, customer address delete). `dev-up.cmd` also failed boot when `DELETE /api/v1/admin/categories/:id/permanent` was missing from the admin endpoint policy registry.

Changes applied:
- **`src/common/redis/redis-connection.ts` (shared):** `buildStandardRedisOptions()`, `attachRedisErrorListener()` (throttles transient errors), `guardRedisDuplicate()`, `installGuardedIORedisDuplicate()` (patches BullMQ internal duplicates), `waitForRedisReady()`. Wired into API Redis plugin, BullMQ plugin, worker boot, API/worker restart subscribers, cart-cleanup ephemeral clients, and `scripts/resume-paused-queues.js`.
- **Local dev Docker:** Base `docker-compose.yml` exposes Redis `6379:6379` for host-side API/workers; `docker-compose.prod.yml` uses `redis.ports: !reset []` so Redis stays container-internal on VPS.
- **Route schemas:** Removed spurious empty `body` from `adminDeleteCouponSchema`, `adminRestoreCouponSchema`, and `deleteAddressSchema` — clients must send bodyless DELETE/POST-without-body as documented.
- **Admin policy registry:** Added `DELETE /api/v1/admin/categories/:id/permanent` → `categories:write` (Layer A).
- **Coupon admin:** Usage column uses compact `used / limit` formatting; analytics excludes soft-deleted coupons; `BUY_X_GET_Y` in response enum; `createdBy` nullable.
- **`AdminRateLimitStore`:** Falls back to in-memory counters when Redis commands fail (multi-instance safety preserved when Redis is healthy).

**Affects:** `redis-connection.ts`, `redis.plugin.ts`, `bullmq.plugin.ts`, `main.ts`, `queues/workers/index.ts`, `cart-cleanup.worker.ts`, `coupons.schemas.ts`, `users.schemas.ts`, `admin-endpoint-policy-registry.ts`, `admin-rate-limit.store.ts`, `frontend/lib/admin-format.ts`, `AdminCouponsList.tsx`.

---

**Admin console data integrity — June 3, 2026:**

Changes: Product editor maps Status → `isActive`, short text → `metaDescription`, Featured → `isFeatured`; removed cosmetic-only fields. `productListItemSchema` exposes `isActive` + `metaDescription`. `GET /admin/payments` returns `customerName`/`customerEmail`; `GET /admin/reviews` returns `productName`/`productSlug`. Per-page `AdminDateRangePicker` with dynamic KPI trend labels (`prevRange`). Frontend tables cleared of mock shipment/payment/review placeholders. Sign-off: 897 unit tests, 59 security invariants, frontend build clean.

**Product image upload — Cloudflare R2 automatic sync — June 3, 2026:**

Changes: `MEDIA_STORAGE_PROVIDER=r2` pushes each admin upload to Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible) synchronously; `ProductImage.url` stores `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL/<clientId>/products/...`. Batch multipart (`file` repeated). Legacy `GET /api/v1/media/*` only when provider is `local`. **Credentials live in Ops UI** (Product Media domain), not bootstrap `.env`. `/health/ready` enforces missing R2 keys. Scripts: `npm run verify:r2-media`. Frontend: multi-file admin picker + Ops config fields.

**Product image upload — VPS filesystem + Cloudflare CDN — June 3, 2026:**

Gap: Admin could only paste external `https://` URLs; no binary upload, no 5 MiB cap, no origin storage.

Changes: `POST /api/v1/admin/products/:id/images/upload` (multipart, magic-byte validation, 5 MiB max); `GET /api/v1/media/products/:productId/:filename` with long-cache headers; `MEDIA_STORAGE_ROOT` / `MEDIA_CDN_BASE_URL` env; delete removes VPS file for hosted URLs; `/api/v1/media` added to `ALWAYS_ALLOWED_PREFIXES`. Frontend: `resolveProductImageUrl`, admin file picker, `NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_CDN_URL`.

---

**VPS automated cleanup script template for multi-client deployments — May 30, 2026:**
Root cause: Manual disk space cleanup was required periodically on the VPS (83% full). The existing cron job only cleaned Docker buildx cache, missing images, containers, volumes, PM2 logs, and frontend build caches. For multi-client VPS deployments, cleanup needs to be systematic and templated.
Changes applied: Created `scripts/vps-cleanup-template.sh` — a configurable bash script template that handles:
- Docker system prune (dangling images/containers/volumes, with 5GB build cache retention)
- Client-specific PM2 log flushing (by process name, not global)
- Next.js build cache cleanup (`.next/cache/*`)
- Old log rotation cleanup (`.gz`/`.old` files >7 days)
- NPM cache cleanup
- System journal vacuum (capped at 200MB)
- GitHub Actions self-hosted runner cache (`_work/*` and `_tool/*`)
- Disk usage reporting with high-usage alerts (>80%)

Also created `scripts/install-vps-cleanup.sh` — an installer that copies the template to `/etc/cron.daily/vps-cleanup-<CLIENT_ID>` with proper variable substitution for client ID, frontend path, and PM2 process name. Scheduled via system cron (runs daily at 06:25 AM alongside other cron.daily tasks).

**Deactivated admin phone number reuse during invite setup — May 30, 2026:**
Root cause: During admin invite consumption (`POST /api/v1/auth/admin/invites/setup/send-otp`), `assertInvitePhoneAvailable` blocked the phone number if it belonged to *any* user except the exact ID matching the invite email. If a user had an old, deactivated admin account using `+911234567890`, and was then invited on a *new* email address, they were permanently blocked from using their phone number on the new account.
Changes applied: Updated `assertInvitePhoneAvailable` to skip the conflict check if the existing user owning the phone number is a deactivated merchant admin (`role=ADMIN`, `isBanned=true`). Their phone number is now effectively "freed up" and can be claimed by a new active account. Customers and active ops/admin users still trigger a 409 Conflict.

**Admin session persistence, idle timeout, and login/setup UX hardening — May 28, 2026:**

Root cause (2026-05-28 cookie same-site): `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` pointed at `localhost:3000` while the UI ran on `localhost:3101`, so `refresh_token` was never sent on reload. Fix: Next rewrite `/api/v1/*`, browser base on storefront origin (`lib/api-base.ts`), deduped refresh (`lib/restore-auth-session.ts`), dev refresh cookies without `Secure` (`auth-cookies.ts`).

**2026-06-03 — admin session restore (mobile/LAN dev):** Client showed infinite loading on `/admin` despite RSC `200`; `/admin/login` reload-looped or had a disabled submit button. Causes: `clearSession()` cleared restore `blocked` (infinite restore), failed restore redirected to `/admin/login` while already on login, shared `admin` restore runtime between login and shell, login reset raced in-flight refresh, OTP channel fetch disabled button, LAN HMR blocked without `allowedDevOrigins`. Fix: `admin` vs `admin-guest` audiences, `clearSession` vs `logoutLocalSession`, `redirectToAdminLoginIfNeeded`, `AdminGuestOnly` non-blocking UI, browser API = page origin, restore deadlines + admin skip `GET /users/me`. **Affects:** `frontend/hooks/use-auth-session-restore.ts`, `contexts/admin-auth-context.tsx`, `lib/api-base.ts`, `next.config.ts`.

**2026-06-06 — admin product hard delete + form validation UX:** Merchants need irreversible catalogue cleanup for mistaken drafts, but order/review history must be protected. Added `DELETE /api/v1/admin/products/:id/permanent` with `409` guard; UI renames soft delete to **Deactivate** and isolates permanent delete in `AdminRowActionsMenu`. Separate fix: validation banner did not highlight fields because Tailwind border utilities overrode error classes and product create lacked Category/Slug inputs — shared `admin-form-validation` helpers, `!border-destructive`, and required Category picker. Frontend `predev` probes backend health to avoid proxy `ECONNREFUSED` noise. **Affects:** `products.service.ts`, `AdminProductEditor.tsx`, `AdminProductsList.tsx`, `lib/admin-form-validation.ts`, `ensure-backend-dev.mjs`.

**2026-06-01 — production admin refresh logout:** Admin OTP verify did not pass abuse/risk context into token issuance, so refresh `deviceKeyHash` mismatched and sessions were revoked on reload. Fix: forward risk on `POST /auth/admin/login/verify-otp`; device binding uses UA+IP only; `refresh_token` `Path=/api/v1`; clear cookie on refresh `401`. Re-login once after deploy if sessions were issued before this patch.

Root cause: `AdminGuard` redirected to `/admin/login` whenever `accessToken` was `null` in the Zustand store — which is always on a cold page load/refresh since Zustand is in-memory only. This meant a valid refresh token cookie was completely ignored on page reload, requiring the admin to re-authenticate every time they refreshed the browser tab. Additionally, the session warning component offered only a page-reload fallback rather than a real token extension, and there was no idle timeout mechanism to auto-logout inactive sessions.

Changes applied:

1. **`AdminGuard` — silent token restoration on page refresh:** On mount, if `accessToken` is absent, the guard attempts `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` before redirecting. On success, claims (`sub`, `role`, `permissions`) are parsed from the JWT to reconstruct a minimal `User` object via `parseAccessTokenClaims`, `setSession` is called to hydrate the Zustand store, and the admin console renders normally. On failure (expired/absent cookie), the guard redirects to `/admin/login`. This restores the JWT+httpOnly-cookie session model to its intended behavior.

2. **`AdminSessionWarning` — real "Extend session" button:** Replaced the page-reload fallback with a `refreshAccessToken()` call that rotates the refresh cookie server-side and updates the in-memory access token via `setAccessToken`. A `Loader2` spinner shows during the network call. An error state is surfaced if the refresh fails (session is no longer valid for admin access) with a "Sign in again" fallback.

3. **`useIdleTimeout` hook (new file `hooks/use-idle-timeout.ts`):** Tracks `mousedown`, `mousemove`, `keydown`, `touchstart`, `wheel`, `scroll`, `click` events. Fires `onWarning` callback after 25 min of inactivity, then `onLogout` callback 5 minutes later. Timers reschedule on each activity event. Designed to be enabled/disabled via prop so it only runs when an admin is authenticated.

4. **`AdminIdleTimeoutModal` (new component):** Modal overlay using `useIdleTimeout`. Shows a countdown timer from 5:00 to 0:00 when warning fires. "Stay signed in" calls `refreshAccessToken()` (same pattern as session warning); "Sign out now" calls `clearSession` + redirect. If the countdown reaches zero, `handleLogout` fires automatically. Modal dismisses on any user activity that arrives while it is open (`onActive` callback hides it). Rendered inside `AdminConsoleShell` so it covers the full console area.

5. **`AdminLoginForm` — UX parity with industry standard admin dashboards:**
   - Password visibility toggle (`Eye`/`EyeOff` icon, `tabIndex={-1}` so it doesn't break form tab order)
   - OTP expiry countdown timer shown inline (`Expires in M:SS` in amber, `Expired` in red when zero)
   - "Resend code" button with 60s cooldown — re-submits credentials to `POST .../request-otp` and restarts both the resend cooldown and the expiry countdown
   - Submit button shows `Loader2` spinner + "Sending code…" during form submission
   - "Verify and sign in" button disabled until OTP is exactly 6 digits

6. **`AdminSetupForm` — UX parity with industry standard onboarding flows:**
   - 2-step progress bar (step 1: Account details → step 2: Verify OTP) with fill animation and checkmark on completion
   - Password visibility toggle on step 1
   - OTP expiry countdown and resend with 60s cooldown on step 2
   - "Back to details" link on step 2 (allows editing name/phone/password before resending)
   - `Loader2` spinner on both "Send OTP" and "Complete setup" buttons
   - Error banner changed from amber warning style to red error style
   - Input placeholders and brand colours (`#23403d`, `#769b97`, `#efe8e4`) applied throughout

Security principles codified:
- **Access token lives only in memory (Zustand).** Refresh cookie is the durable credential — never replicate it to storage.
- **On page refresh, always try `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` before redirecting to login.** An HTTP-only cookie survives page refresh; ignoring it is UX regression, not a security improvement.
- **Idle timeout is complementary to token expiry** — token expiry handles absolute session length; idle timeout handles inactive-but-still-valid sessions.
- **OTP resend must restart the expiry countdown** — showing a stale timer after resend would confuse users about when the new OTP expires.

---

**Merchant admin re-invite after ops deactivation — May 28, 2026:**
- `POST /api/v1/ops/admin-invites` and `/admin/invites/consume` allow emails for **deactivated** merchant admins (`role=ADMIN`, `isBanned=true`). Setup reactivates the existing `User` id (clears ban, refreshes password/permissions) instead of `409 User already exists`. Active admins and customers remain blocked. Ops operator invites reject merchant-admin emails with explicit copy pointing to the merchant admin invite form. `admin-newuser.mjs` aligned.

**Ops-gated admin invite routes moved to `/api/v1/ops/` namespace — May 28, 2026:**

Root cause: The ops session cookie was scoped to `path: '/api/v1/ops'`. Routes `GET/POST /api/v1/admin/invites*` (ops:read/write guarded) sat outside this path, so the browser never sent the cookie to them — every request from the Ops Invites UI returned 401 ("Please sign in to continue"). The naive fix of widening the cookie to `path: '/api/v1'` was evaluated but rejected as a deviation from least-privilege, even though it would have been functionally safe (httpOnly + sameSite:strict).

Fix applied: renamed all 4 ops-authenticated admin invite routes to `GET/POST /api/v1/ops/admin-invites`, `/ops/admin-invites/:inviteId/revoke`, `/ops/admin-invites/cleanup-expired`. Cookie path stays `/api/v1/ops`. Two public bootstrap routes (`/admin/invites/setup/send-otp` and `/admin/invites/consume`) are unchanged — they require no session.

Architecture principle codified: **Any route protected by `opsAuthGuard` must live under `/api/v1/ops/` so the browser-scoped session cookie reaches it.**

---

**SMS channel defaults changed to opt-in; single-channel enforcement added to admin UI — May 28, 2026:**

Root cause identified during CI reliability-gate debugging: `StoreSettings.notifySmsEnabled` defaulted to `true` in the Prisma schema, meaning any first-run upsert of the `storeSettings` row (e.g., triggered by `PATCH /api/v1/admin/settings/shipping` during CI setup) enabled SMS automatically. The `getAvailableOtpChannels` routing layer added SMS to available channels, `resolveEffectiveOtpChannel` picked it as the first fallback, and the admin login OTP route threw HTTP 400 because the CI admin user had no phone number.

Changes applied:
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: `notifySmsEnabled @default(false)` (was `@default(true)`)
- Migration `20260528110000_fix_notify_sms_default`: `ALTER TABLE "StoreSettings" ALTER COLUMN "notifySmsEnabled" SET DEFAULT false`
- `settings.service.ts`, `otp-channel.ts`, `notifications.worker.ts`, `notification-provider.ts`: all SMS env/null fallbacks changed from `true` → `false`
- Admin notifications settings page replaced with a proper single-channel selector UI (`NotificationsChannelPanel`) — radio buttons for Email / SMS / WhatsApp, enforcing single active channel

Design principle codified: **Email is the default and only auto-active channel. SMS and WhatsApp are opt-in, enabled explicitly via Ops UI credentials + Admin Settings channel selector.**

---

**OTP emails (and every other notification) silently stop after a system restart — `notifications` queue left paused by drain protocol, no recovery on worker boot — May 26, 2026:**

Reported by an operator on the Sri Sai Baba Ghee Sweets VPS: after a routine ops `system-restart` action verified earlier in the day, every subsequent OTP request returned HTTP 200 from `POST /api/v1/ops/otp/request`, the `OpsOtpChallenge` row was created in Postgres with status `PENDING`, but no email ever arrived. SMS and other notification templates were equally affected. Workers were "up", health endpoint reported `db` and `redis` both `connected`, `RESEND_API_KEY` was present in both `sbgs-backend` and `sbgs-workers` envs (loaded from `.env` since this client has not migrated it into the Ops DB overlay), and there were zero error/warn log lines anywhere.

The smoking gun was in the Redis state for the `notifications` queue:

```
bull:notifications:wait      list len = 0
bull:notifications:active    list len = 0
bull:notifications:paused    list len = 3   ← three OTP jobs stuck in paused list
bull:notifications:completed zset = 31      ← jobs that completed earlier in the day
bull:notifications:meta      paused = 1     ← queue is flagged as paused
```

The three jobs in `bull:notifications:paused` mapped one-to-one with three `OpsOtpChallenge` rows whose status remained `PENDING` (operator could not enter the OTP because the email never arrived). The most recent two `VERIFIED` challenges — older by a few minutes — confirmed the system had been delivering OTPs perfectly until a specific point in time.

Tracing the timeline against `cart-cleanup.worker.ts`:

1. Operator verified a `system-restart` OTP at T-5min and confirmed restart.
2. The `scheduled-process-restart` BullMQ job fired ~5 minutes later in the workers container.
3. That job's drain protocol called `Queue.pause()` on every queue in `DRAINABLE_QUEUE_KEYS` (`order-processing`, `notifications`, `shipping`, `inventory-alerts`, `refunds`, `analytics`, `cart-cleanup`, `reconciliation`) plus `outbox-dispatch` — by design, to stop the influx during the payment drain.
4. It then drained, attempted to call `Queue.resume()` on each queue (`queues/workers/cart-cleanup.worker.ts` lines 670–695), and immediately published the restart signal followed by `process.exit(0)`.
5. The new worker container booted (its log shows only `Ops DB runtime config overlay applied for workers` and `All background workers started successfully and are listening for jobs.` — no resume call, no recovery step).
6. The `notifications` queue was still flagged as paused in Redis. Every subsequent `Queue.add(...)` call from the API (ops OTP, customer OTP via outbox, admin notifications) landed jobs in `bull:notifications:paused` instead of `bull:notifications:wait`. The workers correctly refused to claim from the paused list. Result: silent indefinite outage of every notification channel.

Why the resume step failed without leaving any trace is genuinely uncertain. The most likely causes are:

- The resume promise resolved at the application layer but the Redis write was clipped by `process.exit(0)` racing the round-trip flush of the BullMQ Lua script that toggles the `paused` field on `bull:<q>:meta`.
- The resume threw and triggered `sendTechnicalFailureAlert` — but that alert helper enqueues to the `notifications` queue, which at that exact moment is still paused. The alert vanished into the same paused list as the OTPs.
- In the `maintenance-activation` flow (not this incident's flow but the same pattern), the resume catch handler is a `log.warn` and not even an alert (`cart-cleanup.worker.ts` line 441), which would have hidden a failure even more completely.

Fix is three-layered:

1. **`backend/queues/workers/index.ts` — auto-resume on boot (R4):** the workers process now opens a temporary `Queue` handle for each known queue immediately after constructing the worker Redis connection, calls `isPaused()` on each, and if paused calls `resume()` and re-verifies. Any queue that stays paused triggers a terminal `WorkerBootQueueResumeFailed` technical alert AND a structured warning log. The dead-letter queue is deliberately excluded — the drain protocol never touches it and we don't want to mask a deliberate operator pause there. This makes the workers self-healing on every container boot: after any abnormal exit (the deploy-restart cycle on the VPS, OOM kill, kernel panic), the worst case is "delayed until next deploy" instead of "silent indefinite outage". An operator who manually pauses a queue via Bull Board and then restarts the container is opting into a re-resume — an acceptable trade-off versus the silent outage mode.

2. **`backend/scripts/resume-paused-queues.js` — manual recovery tool:** standalone Node script that does the same thing as the boot recovery, but on demand. Two modes:
   - `node scripts/resume-paused-queues.js --dry-run` — reports which queues are paused without touching them.
   - `node scripts/resume-paused-queues.js` — calls `Queue.resume()` on every paused queue, re-verifies, and prints a summary. Use this if the workers container itself cannot restart, or to confirm queue state after any restart/maintenance cycle. Reads `.env` from the parent directory if `REDIS_URL` is not already set, so it works both from inside the workers container and from a bare shell on the VPS host.

3. **`backend/scripts/diagnose-paused-queues.sh` (call-site documented in this entry but not yet shipped as a separate file):** a 5-line one-liner the operator can paste — for queue in notifications order-processing shipping ...; do docker exec sbgs-redis sh -lc "redis-cli -a \$REDIS_PASSWORD --no-auth-warning HGET bull:$queue:meta paused"; done. Outputs `1` for paused queues, empty for healthy ones.

Detection signature for regressions:

- `bull:<any>:meta` has `paused = 1` after a worker container is fully booted (the `All background workers started successfully` log line has appeared at least 5 seconds ago).
- Jobs accumulate in `bull:<queue>:paused` (list) while `bull:<queue>:wait` and `bull:<queue>:active` stay at 0.
- The bootstrap log emits `Detected queues paused at boot — likely incomplete drain from a prior restart. Auto-resumed.` with `resumed` and `resumeFailed` arrays — this is now an observable signal every time the self-heal fires, even if successful.

**Why we did not just write a Redis Lua patch directly on `bull:<queue>:meta paused`:** the BullMQ pause/resume Lua scripts also move jobs between the `paused` and `wait` lists atomically. Manually `HDEL`ing the `meta.paused` field leaves jobs in the wrong list and the next worker fetch never sees them. Always go through `Queue.resume()`.

**Bare nginx 503 page during maintenance — two-hop `error_page` chain didn't honour `recursive_error_pages off;` — May 2026:**

Sibling bug to the file-install issue below, found while troubleshooting Sri Sai Baba Ghee Sweets on the same day. After the static `maintenance.html` was correctly installed at `/etc/nginx/maintenance/maintenance.html` AND all duplicate server-name conflicts were cleaned out of `sites-enabled/`, hitting the storefront during active maintenance **still** returned nginx's compiled-in bare 503 page (206 bytes) instead of the branded page or the inline fallback.

The gate flow was:

```
auth_request /_maintenance_gate;            # subrequest → 401 (maintenance active)
error_page 401 = @maintenance_block;        # nginx routes to named location
location @maintenance_block { return 503; } # returns 503 from inside an error_page handler
```

…with the intent that the 503 would flow into the server-level `error_page 502 503 /maintenance.html;`. It didn't. Nginx's `recursive_error_pages` directive is `off` by default — meaning an error that occurs **during** error_page processing of another error does NOT trigger a second error_page lookup. So the 503 produced inside `@maintenance_block` (which itself is an error_page handler for the 401) skipped the `error_page 502 503` rule entirely and fell through to nginx's compiled-in default 503 page.

Reproduction (in a 20-line nginx test config, no auth_request needed — any two-hop error_page chain shows it):

```nginx
error_page 502 503 /will-not-be-used;
location @intermediate { internal; return 503; }
location = /probe {
  error_page 418 = @intermediate;
  return 418;
}
# curl /probe → HTTP 503 with body length 197 (nginx default), NOT /will-not-be-used
```

The original template author intended `@maintenance_block` to centralise the 503 fan-in for "diagnostic visibility" (per template comments). But the diagnostic value was negative — it broke the very flow it was meant to make observable.

**Fix:** replace each gated location's `error_page 401 = @maintenance_block;` with the single-hop `error_page 401 =503 /maintenance.html;`. The `=503` syntax simultaneously routes to `/maintenance.html` AND rewrites the response status from 401 to 503 in a single error_page operation — no recursion needed. `@maintenance_block` is deleted entirely. The `/maintenance.html` handler then runs its `try_files` (file → static styled page; missing → `@maintenance_inline` fallback) and the outer `=503` rewrite ensures the wire status is always 503 regardless of which branch wins.

Verified end-to-end with an nginx Alpine container running the rendered template with an `auth_request` gate forced to 401:

| Scenario | Status | Content-Length | Body |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/maintenance.html` missing on disk | 503 | 1812 | `@maintenance_inline` (inline branded HTML) |
| `/maintenance.html` present on disk | 503 | 3631 | Full styled `maintenance.html` |

Both responses correctly carry `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate` and `Retry-After: 15`.

**Why we did not enable `recursive_error_pages on;` instead:** that flag has subtle interactions with `proxy_intercept_errors` and adds globally-applicable behavior across every location — including upstream-proxied paths. The single-hop pattern is strictly more local and strictly more predictable: one nginx error_page lookup per request, period.

**Detection signature for regressions:** during active maintenance on a properly-configured stack, `curl -sI https://<domain>/` should return `Content-Length: 3631` (or `1812` if the static file was deleted). Any other size — especially the `Content-Length: 206` smoking gun — means we've reintroduced the two-hop pattern. The integration test for the maintenance gate should assert on Content-Length explicitly, not just the 503 status.

**Bare nginx 503 page during maintenance — `maintenance.html` install bypassed silently — May 2026:**

Operator on Sri Sai Baba Ghee Sweets triggered maintenance and the storefront returned the **bare Nginx 503 page** ("503 Service Temporarily Unavailable" + `nginx/1.28.3 (Ubuntu)` footer) instead of the branded "We'll be back shortly" page. The maintenance gate itself was working perfectly (auth_request 401 → `@maintenance_block` 503 → `error_page 502 503 /maintenance.html;`); the failure was one step deeper. Nginx tried to read `/etc/nginx/maintenance/maintenance.html`, found nothing on disk, and fell back to its compiled-in default page — which is the worst possible user experience for what should be a friendly downtime moment.

The root cause was a silent skip in `backend/scripts/vps-deploy.sh §3.5a`: the install step uses `sudo -n cp` (non-interactive sudo) so a CI runner without the matching sudoers grant prints a warning and continues. The warning was buried somewhere in a long deploy log and went unnoticed. On a fresh VPS where `/etc/nginx/maintenance/` had never existed, the file was just missing forever after.

**Changes:**

1. **`backend/nginx/client.conf.template` — inline fallback for missing `maintenance.html`.** Added a `@maintenance_inline` named location that returns a single-string `<!DOCTYPE html>...</html>` payload styled to match the brand. Modified `location = /maintenance.html` to use `try_files $uri @maintenance_inline;` so nginx serves the full static page when present and routes to the inline fallback when the file is missing. Picked `try_files` over `error_page 404 = @...` because chaining error_pages requires `recursive_error_pages on;` globally, which has subtle interactions with `proxy_intercept_errors`. The inline page is intentionally minimal (~3 KB) so it stays parseable as a single nginx directive while still delivering a branded experience (badge, headline, copy, color tokens, dark-mode media query).

2. **`backend/scripts/vps-deploy.sh §3.5a — explicit summary at deploy end.** Captured the install outcome into `DEPLOY_MAINTENANCE_PAGE_STATUS` (one of `installed`/`in_sync`/`missing_no_sudo`/`source_missing`) and re-emitted a multi-line, banner-delimited warning at the end of the deploy when the status is anything other than installed/in_sync. The banner can't be buried mid-log; the bottom of every CI run is now where operators look for "did this deploy need follow-up?".

3. **`backend/scripts/install-maintenance-page.sh` — new standalone helper.** Idempotent script that an operator can run any time with `sudo bash scripts/install-maintenance-page.sh`. Validates the source path, creates `/etc/nginx/maintenance/`, copies with 644 perms, and as a sanity check also verifies the live nginx config (in `/etc/nginx/sites-{enabled,available}/<client>.conf`) actually contains the `error_page 502 503 /maintenance.html;` directive (so the operator doesn't install a file that no live config references — that's a separate, equally silent class of bug).

4. **`backend/docs/CLIENT_VPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md §19.5 — updated for the new defense-in-depth.** Symptom table now lists two failure modes (bare nginx page vs. minimal inline page) and which one indicates which underlying problem. Triage steps updated to reference `install-maintenance-page.sh`. Added a top-of-doc quick-symptom row for "minimal inline page" so operators recognise it as "static file missing, run the install script" rather than thinking the inline page is the intended experience.

**Why three layers instead of "just fix the deploy script":**

| Layer | What it guarantees | Failure mode it absorbs |
|---|---|---|
| Static `maintenance.html` at `/etc/nginx/maintenance/` | Full styled experience | — (preferred path) |
| Inline `@maintenance_inline` fallback in nginx config | Branded minimal page (never bare nginx) | Static file missing on disk |
| Deploy-script summary warning | Operator is told to install the file | Static file ALSO missing AND the operator doesn't notice the minimal page |

Pre-2026-05-26 we had only layer 1. A single missed `sudo cp` in a fresh deploy → bare nginx page in front of real customers for the entire maintenance window. Post-2026-05-26 the same missed `sudo cp` is invisible to customers (layer 2) AND is visibly flagged to the operator at the bottom of the deploy log (layer 3).

**Detection signature for future regressions:**

- Customer-visible: storefront returns the bare `nginx/1.x (Ubuntu)` 503 → layer 2 is broken (someone edited the template and dropped `@maintenance_inline`, OR a different `error_page` is masking it).
- Customer-visible: storefront returns the minimal inline page → layer 1 is broken (run `install-maintenance-page.sh`).
- CI log tail shows the `POST-DEPLOY ACTION REQUIRED` banner → layer 1 will be broken on the next maintenance window unless the operator runs the install script.

**Stuck-pending maintenance window — BullMQ-aware fast-promote replaces the 7-minute self-heal grace — May 2026:**

Operator on Sri Sai Baba Ghee Sweets triggered maintenance and observed the storefront banner sit on "Finalising maintenance window. Wrapping up active transactions before the site goes offline. New checkouts are paused." for the full 5–7 minutes past the 2-minute pending window — total time from "set maintenance" to "Nginx blocks the storefront" was ~9 minutes, with **zero in-flight jobs or payments** for the worker to drain. Investigating revealed two compounding defects in the cutover machinery:

1. **`setLoadShedModeDirect` silently no-op'd the `maintenance-activation` enqueue when `fastify.queues?.cartCleanup` was undefined.** The `if (cartCleanupQueue) { await cartCleanupQueue.add(...) }` block at `backend/src/modules/ops/ops.service.ts` line 1955 wrapped only the enqueue in a truthiness check — there was no `else` branch logging the missed enqueue, no technical-failure alert, nothing. The durable `MaintenanceState` row was written, the operator's API call returned success, the warning banner started ticking down, and the entire system then sat with no scheduled work to flip `phase=pending → 'active'`. Compare the same file's `scheduleRestart` (line 2350) which **throws** when the queue is missing — that was the contract we should have been enforcing for maintenance, too.

2. **The read-side self-heal grace (`MAINTENANCE_ACTIVATION_GRACE_MS`, default 7 min) was conservatively sized for worst-case healthy drains, with no fast path for the "worker is broken" failure mode.** The grace must be ≥ worst-case drain (60 s queue + 300 s payment + buffer = ~6:30) so a healthy worker mid-drain is never raced into double-promotion. Pre-fix, that meant the ONLY way out of a stuck-pending state was waiting the full 7 minutes — even when the BullMQ queue trivially had no record of the activation job. The system had all the information it needed to promote immediately ("queue has no matching job AND we're past `pendingUntil + small_grace`") and was throwing it away.

**Changes:**

1. **`backend/src/modules/ops/ops.service.ts` — loud-fail missing queue.** Converted the silent `if (cartCleanupQueue)` skip into an `if (!cartCleanupQueue) { log.error + sendTechnicalFailureAlert } else { enqueue }` pattern. The durable state write still succeeds (operator's intent is preserved; read-side fast-promote recovers the cutover) but the missing-queue case now generates a permanent paper trail: an `error`-level log line with `[setLoadShedModeDirect] fastify.queues.cartCleanup is undefined ...` and a technical-failure alert email to ops with template `MaintenanceActivationEnqueue` and `failureStage: 'QUEUE_ENQUEUE'`. Operators can no longer set maintenance "successfully" and discover hours later that the storefront never actually went down.

2. **`backend/src/common/reliability/maintenance-state.ts` — BullMQ-aware fast-promote.** Introduced four new exports:
   - `ActivationJobStatus = 'present' | 'missing' | 'unknown'` — what the BullMQ probe can return.
   - `VerifyActivationJobExists` — the callback shape `readMaintenanceState` accepts.
   - `DEFAULT_MAINTENANCE_FAST_PROMOTE_GRACE_MS = 15 * 1000` (overridable via `MAINTENANCE_FAST_PROMOTE_GRACE_MS` env var) — the short grace past `pendingUntil` before the read path will probe the queue.
   - `maybeFastPromotePending` — pure helper that flips `phase: 'active'` IFF status is `'missing'` AND now is past `pendingUntil + fastPromoteGraceMs`.
   - `buildBullMQActivationVerifier` — adapter that turns a queue with `getJobs(['delayed','active','completed','failed'])` into the `VerifyActivationJobExists` callback. Filters by `name === 'maintenance-activation'` and `timestamp >= setAt - 5_000` (so a stale job from a previous maintenance cycle doesn't mask a genuinely-missing current job).
   - `wrapVerifierWithTimeout` — bounds the probe to 500 ms (default). On timeout or exception the wrapper returns `'unknown'`, which falls through to the long-grace path. Slow Redis can never block a storefront request.
   
   `readMaintenanceState` was refactored to apply both healers from a single side-effect-free `applySelfHeal` closure, with one shared `persistPromotion` write path. The fast-promote runs first (only when a verifier is wired); if it returns `'present'` or `'unknown'`, the existing long-grace fallback still runs. This preserves the "system cannot get stuck in pending" contract even when BullMQ itself is unreachable.

3. **`backend/src/common/reliability/maintenance-state.ts` — `readMaintenanceStateFromRequest` auto-wires the verifier.** When `fastify.queues.cartCleanup` is available on the request server, the convenience wrapper builds the verifier + timeout wrapper transparently. Direct `readMaintenanceState` callers that don't have BullMQ access (worker, boot path, admin write paths) keep their existing semantics — they just don't get the fast-promote optimization. This is the right boundary: the storefront/Nginx hot path benefits, the worker can't usefully verify itself, the boot path can't verify a queue that's not initialized yet.

4. **Tests added:** 22 new test cases covering `maybeFastPromotePending` (present/missing/unknown × inside-grace/past-grace × mode permutations), `readMaintenanceState` with each verifier outcome, `buildBullMQActivationVerifier` timestamp-filter behavior, `wrapVerifierWithTimeout` happy-path + timeout + throw, and `resolveMaintenanceFastPromoteGraceMs` env override parsing. The existing 11 long-grace tests still pass unchanged — legacy callers (without a verifier) get the legacy 7-min behavior. One regression test added in `ops.service.test.ts` to prove the loud-fail path actually logs + alerts when `fastify.queues.cartCleanup` is removed.

**Expected operator-facing behavior after this fix:**

| Scenario | Before this fix | After this fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Worker healthy, no in-flight work | 2 min pending + ~1 s drain = ~2 min total | unchanged (~2 min total) |
| Worker healthy, 30 s of queue work | 2 min pending + ~30 s drain = ~2:30 total | unchanged (~2:30 total) |
| Worker healthy, payments drain to 5 min cap | 2 min pending + 5 min drain = ~7 min total | unchanged (~7 min total; verifier returns 'present', long grace covers it) |
| Worker offline or queue plugin missing | 2 min pending + 7 min self-heal grace = ~9 min total | 2 min pending + 15 s fast grace + ~1 ms probe = **~2:15 total** |
| Worker offline AND Redis unreachable | 2 min pending + 7 min self-heal grace = ~9 min total | unchanged (~9 min — long grace remains the final safety net when BullMQ probe can't answer) |

The new env knob `MAINTENANCE_FAST_PROMOTE_GRACE_MS` (default 15000) lets operators tune the fast-promote sensitivity. Setting it to `0` makes the fast-promote fire on the very first read past `pendingUntil` — useful for staging environments where you want maintenance to flip nearly instantaneously and don't care about pause-grace races. Production should keep the default to absorb BullMQ delayed-job polling jitter.

**Why we couldn't catch this earlier:** the existing maintenance unit tests use mocked Prisma + Redis and either (a) test the worker handler directly with no enqueue gap to exercise, or (b) test `readMaintenanceState` with no verifier wired (so the long-grace fallback was the only path under test). The "enqueue missed, BullMQ-aware self-heal needed" failure mode was orthogonal to both. The new tests now cover all four `verifier × grace` quadrants, and the loud-fail test directly mutates `fastify.queues.cartCleanup = undefined` to prove the alert path fires.

**Detection signature for future regressions:** if maintenance ever takes more than ~2:30 to flip the storefront to 503 again,

```bash
bash backend/scripts/diagnose-maintenance.sh
```

Now reads:
- Step 6 (BullMQ counts) — `delayed=0 waiting=0 completed=0` for `maintenance-activation` confirms the enqueue was skipped
- Step 7 (worker logs) — empty `[maintenance-activation]` filter confirms the worker never picked anything up
- API logs (`docker compose logs backend`) — search for `fastify.queues.cartCleanup is undefined` to confirm the loud-fail fired

If those three confirm the silent-skip pattern, the cause is the BullMQ plugin failing to register at boot — investigate `src/common/plugins/bullmq.plugin.ts` and rebuild the backend image. The storefront should now still flip to 503 within ~2:15 thanks to the fast-promote, but the underlying queue layer is broken for ALL background work and must be fixed before the next maintenance window.

**Maintenance gate bypass — `if` inside `location` ran before `auth_request` populated its variable — May 2026:**

Live verification on Sri Sai Baba Ghee Sweets surfaced the second structural bug in the maintenance gate from the same May 2026 work. After fixing the nginx template's `${CLIENT_DOMAIN}` substitution (entry below), the storefront still served `200 OK` from Next.js during active maintenance instead of `503` + `maintenance.html`. End-to-end debugging proved every component was healthy:

- `MaintenanceState.phase = 'active'` in Postgres ✅
- `GET /api/v1/maintenance/gate` from backend returned `200 OK` + `x-maintenance-active: 1` ✅
- Live nginx config contained `auth_request /_maintenance_gate;` + `auth_request_set $maintenance_active $upstream_http_x_maintenance_active;` + `if ($maintenance_active = "1") { return 503; }` ✅
- Nginx workers reloaded the config (verified via `journalctl -u nginx`) ✅
- A temporary `add_header X-Debug-Maintenance "value=[$maintenance_active]" always;` inserted into the gated `location /` block confirmed `X-Debug-Maintenance: value=[1]` — the variable WAS captured ✅

Yet `curl -sI https://<domain>/` still returned `200 OK` with `X-Powered-By: Next.js`. The bug was a fundamental Nginx phase-ordering issue:

```
Nginx request lifecycle (in order):
  1. REWRITE phase   ← `if ($maintenance_active = "1")` runs here, variable is EMPTY
  2. ACCESS phase    ← `auth_request /_maintenance_gate` fires here, sets $maintenance_active = "1"
  3. CONTENT phase   ← `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:${STOREFRONT_PORT}` runs, returns Next.js HTML
  4. OUTPUT phase    ← `add_header X-Debug-Maintenance "value=[$maintenance_active]"` runs, variable IS "1"
```

The `if` directive lives in `ngx_http_rewrite_module` which runs in step 1, BEFORE auth_request in step 2 can populate the variable. `if ("" = "1")` evaluates to false on every request; the `return 503` never fires; the request falls through to `proxy_pass`. The `add_header` debug instrumentation in step 4 sees the populated value, which is why the bug looked invisible in casual inspection — the variable was "obviously" being captured correctly. The route comment in `maintenance.routes.ts` even documented the choice of `200+header` over `401/403` with a reasoning that was structurally incompatible with how Nginx evaluates `if`.

The original "why not 401/403" reasoning ("Nginx can't tell whether the 401 originated from the gate or from the real proxy_pass response, so an `error_page 401 = /maintenance.html` mapping would shadow real auth UX") was also wrong: Nginx's `error_page` directive only catches errors generated by Nginx itself (including `auth_request` rejections). It does NOT intercept upstream proxy responses unless `proxy_intercept_errors on;` is set, which the template deliberately leaves off. So a 401 from Next.js or Fastify passes through to the client unaffected, and the maintenance flow can safely use a location-scoped `error_page 401`.

**Changes:**

1. **`backend/src/modules/maintenance/maintenance.routes.ts` — gate route returns 401 when blocked.** Replaced `return { allowed: false }` (implicit 200) with `reply.status(401); return { allowed: false };` on the maintenance-blocks-this-path branch. The `X-Maintenance-Active: 1` header stays on both 200 and 401 responses for backward compatibility with any direct API caller (the storefront banner polls `/api/v1/maintenance/status` instead, so no client code change is required). Route response schema updated to declare both the 200 and 401 success shapes. The function-level docblock rewritten to explain the phase-ordering issue + why the new pattern is safe.
2. **`backend/nginx/client.conf.template` — replaced every `auth_request_set` + `if` block with `error_page 401 = @maintenance_block;`.** Six gated locations updated (`location ~ ^/api/v1/(orders|payments/...)`, `location ~ ^/api/v1/admin/`, `location ~ ^/api/v1/(products|reviews|shipping/track)/`, `location ~ ^/api/v1/(cart|wishlist|users/me)/`, `location /api/`, `location /`). Added a single `location @maintenance_block { internal; return 503; }` at server level. The 503 flows into the existing `error_page 502 503 /maintenance.html;` mapping unchanged. The template's top-of-file maintenance block comment rewritten to document the new request flow and explicitly call out the phase-ordering bug as the reason for the change.
3. **Tests updated to match the new contract.** `maintenance.routes.test.ts` — the storefront-paths-during-active test now expects `statusCode 401` (previously 200) while keeping the `X-Maintenance-Active: 1` header assertion. `maintenance.e2e-route-matrix.test.ts` — the gate-during-active and gate-after-self-heal tests both updated similarly. The `pending` and `normal` allowed-path assertions keep `statusCode 200` (only the blocked branch flips to 401). All 28 unit + 7 e2e tests pass.

**Why we couldn't catch this with our existing test suite:** every maintenance test uses `app.inject()` to hit the Fastify route directly. The bug was in Nginx's location-block evaluation order, which Fastify-only tests have no way to exercise. There's no shipped containerised nginx-in-the-loop test harness in the template — the live VPS was, by accident, the first place this code path was actually exercised end-to-end. The closest future safeguard would be a docker-compose-based integration test that brings up nginx + backend + a fake upstream and asserts a real curl through nginx returns 503 + maintenance.html during active maintenance. Adding that test is tracked but out of scope for this hotfix.

**Detection signature for future regressions:** if maintenance ever fails to block the storefront again, the fastest single-command check is:

```bash
curl -sI http://localhost:<BACKEND_PORT>/api/v1/maintenance/gate -H 'x-original-uri: /' \
  | grep -E '^HTTP|x-maintenance-active'
```

The expected output when maintenance is active is `HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized` + `x-maintenance-active: 1`. If you see `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, the gate has reverted to the broken 200-based contract (someone reverted the route change) and nginx will silently let traffic through. A live curl through nginx (`curl -sI https://<domain>/` while maintenance is active) must return `HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable` and the HTML body must contain the maintenance page markup.

---

**Nginx config template installed verbatim — `client1.com` placeholder reached production — May 2026:**

The first end-to-end maintenance-mode test on Sri Sai Baba Ghee Sweets surfaced a long-standing structural bug in `backend/nginx/client.conf.template`. The template was authored as a fully-formed nginx config with `client1.com` and `3101`/`3001` literally hardcoded — the name "template" referred to the fact that operators were expected to manually edit those values for each client before installing. `vps-deploy.sh §3.5b` (added earlier in the same May 2026 session) then assumed the template was byte-installable and did `sudo cp $NGINX_TEMPLATE $NGINX_LIVE` directly. The first deploy that triggered the auto-sync path installed a config with literal `client1.com` referenced in four places:

```
ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/client1.com/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/client1.com/privkey.pem;
server_name client1.com www.client1.com;  (×2, in :80 and :443 blocks)
```

`nginx -t` rejected the rewritten file with `cannot load certificate "/etc/letsencrypt/live/client1.com/fullchain.pem": BIO_new_file() failed (SSL: error:80000002:system library::No such file or directory)` and `systemctl reload nginx` aborted. Because the reload aborted, the *running* nginx kept serving from the previous in-memory config (which had no `auth_request /_maintenance_gate` directive, since it pre-dated the May 2026 maintenance work). End result: the backend correctly flipped `MaintenanceState` to `active` and the gate route correctly returned `X-Maintenance-Active: 1`, but the storefront still rendered normally because nginx never gained the gate directives that translate that header into a 503 → `maintenance.html`. The symptom from outside looked like "maintenance gate is broken end-to-end" when the actual fault was a single hardcoded domain in an otherwise-correct config template.

**Changes:**

1. **Parameterised `backend/nginx/client.conf.template`.** Replaced every `client1.com` (4 occurrences) with `${CLIENT_DOMAIN}`, every `127.0.0.1:3001` (11 occurrences) with `127.0.0.1:${BACKEND_PORT}`, and every `127.0.0.1:3101` (2 occurrences) with `127.0.0.1:${STOREFRONT_PORT}`. The file is now a true envsubst template — installing it verbatim deliberately fails so operators can't miss the rendering step. Top-of-file banner documents the three required variables, the exact `envsubst` invocation, and points at `vps-deploy.sh §3.5b` for the automated path. The `${BACKEND_PORT}` parameterisation also makes the template ready for multi-tenant VPS layouts where each client's backend binds a different host port.
2. **Rewrote `backend/scripts/vps-deploy.sh` §3.5b to render via envsubst.** The auto-sync block now (a) resolves `CLIENT_DOMAIN` from `STOREFRONT_URL` in `.env`, (b) resolves `STOREFRONT_PORT` from `.env` (required), (c) resolves `BACKEND_PORT` from `.env` with a `3001` default (the stable docker-compose host mapping), (d) `envsubst`s the template into a tmpfile, (e) verifies the rendered file contains zero unsubstituted `${...}` placeholders and aborts the deploy if any remain, (f) diffs the *rendered* output against the live config, and (g) only then does `cp + nginx -t + systemctl reload`. Refuses to render if `CLIENT_DOMAIN` or `STOREFRONT_PORT` are missing — failing the deploy at the validate step rather than letting an unrenderable file reach nginx -t. First-deploy path (live config doesn't exist yet) is also covered.
3. **`backend/docs/CLIENT_VPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md §11.1` expanded** with a prominent "this template is not byte-installable" callout at the top, the explicit `envsubst` command for manual installs, and a corresponding update to the per-client setup steps (step 2 now describes the placeholders rather than telling operators to manually edit `server_name` + cert paths).
4. **`backend/docs/CLIENT_VPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md §19.3` recovery procedure rewritten** to use `envsubst` for the manual nginx sync, with an inline sanity check that greps the rendered file for any remaining `${...}` strings so a missing env var can't slip through silently. Cross-references this hardening entry so the connection between the symptom (storefront not blocked despite `phase=active`) and the fix is one click away.
5. **`backend/docs/CLIENT_VPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md §22 sudoers grants updated.** The auto-sync cp now sources from `/tmp/*.nginx.conf` (the rendered tmpfile) instead of from the repo path, so the NOPASSWD entry was widened to match `/tmp/*.nginx.conf` and `/tmp/tmp.*` sources. Still scoped to a specific dest (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/*.conf`), so the grant doesn't give the runner general nginx config write access.

**Why the auto-sync block's existence made this worse, not better:** Before the May 2026 auto-sync addition, operators copied the template manually once during initial setup and edited the four `client1.com` references inline. The live config diverged from the repo template forever, but that was fine — the live one had the right domain. When auto-sync was added, every CD deploy started rewriting the live config from the repo's literal-`client1.com` template, breaking what previously worked. This is the standard "automation enforces what you actually have, not what you meant to have" failure mode. Parameterising the template was the only correct fix — any partial workaround (allowlist of substring replacements in the sync step, etc.) would have left another sharp edge somewhere else.

**Detection signature for future deploys:** a successful `vps-deploy.sh §3.5b` log line now reads `Nginx config in sync with rendered template — no reload required.` or `Nginx reload succeeded.` If the template ever drifts again, the §3.5b block fails with an explicit message naming which env var is missing — no more silent fallbacks to a broken config.

**Missing `nginx/maintenance.html` asset — bare nginx 500 page instead of friendly downtime — May 2026:**

A live VPS incident surfaced a long-standing structural gap: the Nginx config template (`backend/nginx/client.conf.template`) wires `error_page 502 503 /maintenance.html;` mapped to `location = /maintenance.html { root /etc/nginx/maintenance; internal; }`, but the template's source file `backend/nginx/maintenance.html` was never committed to the repo. The `CLIENT_VPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` §5 setup steps instructed operators to `sudo cp nginx/maintenance.html /etc/nginx/maintenance/maintenance.html` — and that copy silently failed for every new install ever done from this template, because the source didn't exist.

The downstream effect was incident-grade: any backend 5xx (transient slowness, a single failing health check, a maintenance window when the gate returns 503, a `auth_request` gate timeout) → Nginx tries to render `error_page 502 503 /maintenance.html` → file not on disk → Nginx falls back to its **compiled-in default 500 page**, which is unbranded "500 Internal Server Error / nginx/1.x (Ubuntu)" plain HTML. From the operator's perspective, what should have been a friendly 15-second downtime page looked like a fatal site outage every time the backend so much as stuttered. The `/ops` console kept working (the location bypasses the gate), making the symptom even more confusing — "site is down but ops is up" usually points operators at the storefront/Next.js layer rather than the actual missing static asset.

**Changes:**

1. **Created `backend/nginx/maintenance.html`** with a branded, accessible downtime page: 15-second meta-refresh, `Retry-After: 15` (set by the existing `location = /maintenance.html` block in the template), light/dark theme respect via `color-scheme: light dark` + `prefers-color-scheme`, animated status pulse, explicit cart/payment safety message. Single file, no external assets, < 4 KB so it inlines in a single TCP segment. Lives in the template repo so every client gets it on first deploy without manual file creation.
2. **`backend/scripts/vps-deploy.sh` §3.5a auto-install on every deploy.** Before the nginx config drift check, the script now checks whether `/etc/nginx/maintenance/maintenance.html` differs from `backend/nginx/maintenance.html` in the repo and `sudo cp`s the file if they differ. Idempotent: a `cmp -s` check skips the cp on no-op deploys. When the runner lacks passwordless sudo for the cp, it logs a clear warning + the exact manual command so the gap can't go silent again. Requires new sudoers grants in `/etc/sudoers.d/<runner-user>` (documented in `CLIENT_VPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md §22`).
3. **`backend/docs/CLIENT_VPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md §19.5 dedicated triage section.** Documents the exact symptom (bare nginx 500 page with `nginx/1.x (Ubuntu)` banner, while `/ops` reaches its React shell), the two distinct failure modes that produce identical-looking output (gate subrequest failure vs. missing maintenance.html), a copy-pasteable 7-step triage block that prints container state + backend health + direct gate probe + on-disk asset check + nginx error log + DB MaintenanceState row, and three recovery paths including an emergency `sed`-based gate-disable snippet for getting the storefront back instantly while the backend is debugged.
4. **`backend/docs/CLIENT_VPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md §22 sudoers grants extended** with two additional NOPASSWD entries scoped to `mkdir -p /etc/nginx/maintenance` and `cp /var/www/*/backend/nginx/maintenance.html /etc/nginx/maintenance/maintenance.html`. These are narrow enough to grant safely (specific paths, specific commands) and unlock the §3.5a auto-install without giving the runner general root.

**Why the gate uses `error_page 502 503` (mapping unrelated backend 5xx into the maintenance page) rather than only the explicit maintenance state:** the same page deliberately covers both — planned maintenance via the gate's 503-via-header pathway, AND transient backend 502s during the brief container-swap window of each deploy. The setup means a deploy that takes 4 seconds to restart the backend shows the same friendly downtime page that planned maintenance does, instead of a cascade of failed-request alerts. This is intentional and correct; the only problem was that the file wasn't on disk.

**VPS deploy hygiene — phantom-container start failure, explicit stop+rm+up sequence, fail-fast on uncleanable tombstones — May 2026:**

The previous "Dead-container sweep + `--force-recreate --remove-orphans`" hardening (entry below) caught most cases but produced a new failure mode in production: when the CI runner could not delete on-disk tombstone directories at `/var/lib/docker/containers/<id>/` (no passwordless sudo for `rm`), the sweep partially succeeded — `docker rm -f` cleared the runtime record but the on-disk directory survived and the daemon kept reporting the container as `Dead` on the next listing. The subsequent `docker compose up --force-recreate` then entered Compose v2's "rename-then-replace" path:

```
Container f6b1a3c38046  Stopping
Container f6b1a3c38046_sbgs-backend  Recreate   ← rename of the ghost as a "backup"
Container f6b1a3c38046  Error while Stopping                ← ghost can't actually stop (no runtime)
Container f6b1a3c38046  Removed
Container f6b1a3c38046_sbgs-backend  Recreated  ← new canonical container created
…
Container sbgs-backend  Started                 ← new container live and healthy
Container f6b1a3c38046  Starting                            ← Compose tries to start the renamed-away ghost
Error response from daemon: No such container: f6b1a3c38046…
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

The new canonical containers were live and serving traffic, but Compose's bookkeeping still queued a trailing `start` call against the original ghost ID, which failed and made CD exit 1. Three consecutive deploys aborted this way before we caught it. The hardening below replaces the broken `--force-recreate` step with an explicit sequence that bypasses Compose's rename machinery entirely, and makes §1.75 abort the deploy with explicit recovery instructions when the sweep can't fully clean tombstones (instead of silently proceeding into the broken `--force-recreate` path).

**Changes:**

1. **`backend/scripts/vps-deploy.sh` §1.75 verification + fail-fast.** The sweep now (a) widens its scan to include `created` and `removing` containers (not just `dead`/`exited`), (b) tries privileged tombstone removal with `sudo -n` (fails silently if the runner lacks passwordless sudo), and (c) **re-runs the same query after the destructive pass and aborts the deploy** with `fail "Deploy aborted: Dead-container tombstones detected and could not be fully cleaned automatically."` if any stale containers remain. The error message includes the exact recovery command (`bash scripts/cleanup-stale-compose-state.sh <project>` on the VPS as a sudo user) and the sudoers entries needed to make this fully automatic in future runs. We'd rather fail one deploy with a clear instruction than three deploys with a misleading `No such container` trace.
2. **`backend/scripts/vps-deploy.sh` §4 explicit stop + rm + up.** Replaced the single `docker compose up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans` line with three discrete steps: (i) `docker compose stop backend workers redis` (graceful shutdown by service name), (ii) a loop that runs `docker rm -f ${COMPOSE_PROJECT}-backend` etc. (force-remove by canonical container name, no-op if the name doesn't exist), and (iii) `docker compose up -d --remove-orphans <services>` (fresh create, no rename machinery involved because the names are already free). Eliminates the rename-then-replace path entirely; `--remove-orphans` is preserved on the `up` so old service definitions (e.g. in-compose `postgres` from before host-Postgres migration) are still cleaned.
3. **`backend/docs/CLIENT_VPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` §19.2 expanded.** The Dead-container-tombstones section now describes the phantom-start failure mode explicitly, with the abridged Compose log block above as a fingerprint operators can match against, and walks through the cleanup-script recovery + optional sudoers grant for automatic recovery.

**Why we removed `--force-recreate` rather than fixing Compose:** Compose v2's rename-then-replace path is the upstream behaviour for `--force-recreate`, and we can't ship a patch to docker-compose from a client repo. The cleanest defence is to put the swap entirely in our own hands: stop, rm by name, up — three commands that each do one thing and don't depend on Compose's idea of "what was here before."

**Why the explicit sequence has no extra downtime vs. `--force-recreate`:** Both paths stop the old container, remove it, and create a new one. The old `--force-recreate` did all three in one `up` invocation; the new sequence splits them into three lines but executes the same actual work. Measured downtime is unchanged (~3–5 seconds per service). The Nginx maintenance page handles the window either way.

**VPS deploy hygiene — Dead-container sweep, `--force-recreate --remove-orphans`, Nginx drift detection — May 2026:**

A live VPS deploy uncovered three deployment-hygiene gaps that had nothing to do with the maintenance feature itself but had let stale Docker state and unsynced Nginx config silently bypass code that was already correctly built and on the VPS:

1. **Dead-container tombstones from prior deploys.** Every backend/workers rebuild replaces the underlying image. If `docker image prune` ever reaped an image while a container record still referenced it (this happens after enough consecutive deploys that pile up dangling layers), the container ends up in Docker's `Dead` state. `docker rm -f` then reports "No such container" because the container is gone from Docker's runtime, but the on-disk directory at `/var/lib/docker/containers/<id>/` survives. Compose picks it up via project labels and tries to "Recreate" the container on every subsequent `docker compose up`, printing scary `Error response from daemon: No such container: <sha>` lines and — in some Compose v2 versions — refusing to start the live services until the tombstone is gone.
2. **Manual ops without the prod overlay.** Operators reaching for `docker compose up -d backend workers` (rather than the CD script) regularly forget the `-f docker-compose.prod.yml` flag. The base `docker-compose.yml` declares an in-compose `postgres` service with `container_name: <client>-postgres` and `ports: 5432:5432`, which immediately conflicts with the host's native Postgres on the same port. The `up` half-succeeds (backend + workers start) but the failed-to-bind `postgres` container leaks a half-initialised entry that becomes the next Dead tombstone.
3. **Nginx config drift.** Changes to `nginx/client.conf.template` in the repo do not automatically apply on the VPS — the file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/<client>.conf` only updates when an operator manually `cp`s it and reloads. This is how the new `auth_request /_maintenance_gate` directive (added the same week as this hardening) was missed during the first attempted maintenance-mode test in production: every other part of the system was correct, but Nginx was still using the previous config and didn't gate the storefront.

**Changes:**

1. **`backend/scripts/vps-deploy.sh` §1.75 Dead-container sweep.** Before building, the script enumerates every container labeled `com.docker.compose.project=<this>` with `status=dead` or `status=exited`, force-removes them, and drops their on-disk tombstone directories from `/var/lib/docker/containers/`. Safe to run on every deploy: filtered by project label, so other projects on the same VPS are unaffected; only matches containers that are already not-running, so the live backend/workers/redis are never touched.
2. **`backend/scripts/vps-deploy.sh` §4 `--force-recreate --remove-orphans` on every `up`.** Defends against the residual container references left over after step 1 and any orphaned services from older compose-file revisions (the in-compose `postgres` from before host-Postgres migration; the `jaeger` from the optional OTEL overlay).
3. **`backend/scripts/vps-deploy.sh` §3.5 Nginx drift detection.** After migrations and before container swap, the script diffs `nginx/client.conf.template` against the live `/etc/nginx/sites-available/<project>.conf`. In default mode it logs a clear warning if they differ. With `NGINX_AUTO_RELOAD=1` in `.env`, it syncs the template, runs `nginx -t`, and reloads — failure of the test aborts the deploy so a broken config never goes live. The auto-reload requires passwordless sudo for `cp`, `nginx -t`, and `systemctl reload nginx` on the runner user; without those grants the script stays in warn-only mode.
4. **`backend/scripts/cleanup-stale-compose-state.sh` for manual recovery.** Standalone operator tool: lists Dead/Exited containers for a given compose project, force-removes them, deletes on-disk tombstones, restarts the Docker daemon to refresh its container index, and waits for the daemon to come back. Live containers come back via `restart: unless-stopped` in `docker-compose.yml`. Documented inline with safety guarantees (only touches labeled containers; volumes untouched).
5. **`backend/.env.example` rewritten guidance.** The `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.prod.yml` + `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=<client_id>` pair was previously commented out with vague guidance. The block is now relabelled **VPS: REQUIRED** with the two specific failure modes that occur without them, plus pointers to the cleanup script if you've already accumulated Dead containers. Also adds a documented `NGINX_AUTO_RELOAD=0` entry for the new auto-reload behaviour.

**Why we don't just disable image-prune in CD:** Pruning dangling images is essential on multi-client VPS hosts (we observed ~20 GB of leftover BuildKit layers after 35 deploys in 40 hours). The right answer is to clean up containers before the prune, not stop pruning — which is exactly what step 1 above does.

**Maintenance mode self-heal — read-side fallback for stuck `pending` state — May 2026:**

The original maintenance mode design relied entirely on a delayed BullMQ `maintenance-activation` job to flip `pending → active` after the 2-minute warning window plus drain. In production we observed a silent-failure mode where the storefront stayed accessible indefinitely after the countdown ended: the worker container had been rebuilt before the `maintenance-activation` handler landed in its image, so BullMQ saw the job name but had no matching handler — the job was marked complete and the durable state was never flipped. From the operator's perspective the countdown hit `00:00` and nothing happened.

**Change:**

1. **Read-side self-heal in `readMaintenanceState`** (`src/common/reliability/maintenance-state.ts`). Introduced `maybePromoteOverduePending` — a pure function that promotes a `mode='maintenance' phase='pending'` record to `phase='active'` when `now > pendingUntil + MAINTENANCE_ACTIVATION_GRACE_MS` (default 7 minutes; 1 minute above the 6-minute worst-case drain). The promotion is applied to every read of the state. When triggered from the cache/DB read paths, the promoted record is persisted back via `writeMaintenanceState` so other replicas observe `active` on their next read instead of each independently re-deriving the fallback. When triggered from the in-process memo (5 s TTL), the promotion is published asynchronously to avoid slowing the hot path. DB write failures during self-heal fall back to a Redis cache write so the local guard still gates traffic immediately, even with a partially-degraded persistence layer.
2. **Cutover catch block in the worker** (`queues/workers/cart-cleanup.worker.ts`). Any exception thrown during the maintenance-activation handler is now caught at the handler level: a `MaintenanceActivationCutoverFailed` technical-failure alert is dispatched (recipient: `ops-maintenance`), and the error is logged with the full stack via the new module-level pino logger. BullMQ marks the job as failed (no retries — the read-side self-heal owns recovery from here).
3. **Structured pino logging at every cutover milestone.** The handler emits `[maintenance-activation] job picked up`, `state confirmed pending; beginning drain`, `state flipped to active`, and `background queues resumed for post-cutover processing` log lines so operators can trace any cutover in plain `docker compose logs workers`. Absence of these lines after a cutover attempt is a hard signal that the worker container is running stale code.
4. **`MAINTENANCE_ACTIVATION_GRACE_MS` env var** to tune the grace per tenant if the drain timeouts are customised. Default 420000 (7 min). Resolved per-read so the value is hot-reloadable without a worker restart.
5. **Frontend banner state machine extended.** `MaintenanceBanner.tsx` now has three render states: `pending` with countdown > 0 (warning), `pending` with countdown = 0 (finalising — "wrapping up active transactions before the site goes offline"), and `active` ("we'll be back online shortly"). The middle state covers the drain window where `pendingUntil` has passed but the worker hasn't written `active` yet, giving customers an accurate signal during what was previously a confusing `STARTS IN 00:00` UX.
6. **`backend/scripts/diagnose-maintenance.sh`** added for VPS troubleshooting — prints the current `MaintenanceState` row, BullMQ delayed/waiting/completed counts for `cart-cleanup`, worker logs filtered for `[maintenance-activation]`, the live `X-Maintenance-Active` header from the gate, and whether the running Nginx config has the `auth_request /_maintenance_gate` directive. The script ends with a quick-action guide that maps each observed pattern (empty log lines, missing nginx directive, stuck DB row) to the exact recovery command.
7. **Tests.** Added 11 unit tests in `maintenance-state.test.ts` covering `maybePromoteOverduePending` in isolation, the cache-hit + DB-hit promotion paths, the grace-window respect, and the DB-write-failure fallback. Added 2 e2e route-matrix tests in `maintenance.e2e-route-matrix.test.ts` exercising the stuck-pending recovery end-to-end (real guard + real maintenance routes + in-memory Postgres/Redis store).

**Why grace = 7 min rather than instant promotion:** The worker drain has its own timeouts — `RESTART_QUEUE_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` (60 s) and `RESTART_PAYMENT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` (300 s = 5 min). Worst-case healthy drain is ~6 min. Setting the grace to 7 min gives a 1-minute cushion above the drain so a healthy worker always wins the race and writes `active` before the read-side fallback triggers. The fallback only fires when the worker is dead or missing the handler.

**Why we promote-on-read rather than scheduling a backup BullMQ job:** A backup job would have the same single point of failure — if the worker is dead or running stale code, both jobs fail. The read path runs on every API replica and depends only on Postgres + Redis (the storefront's existing critical-path infrastructure), so it is the most robust place to put the recovery.

**Persistent `maintenance` load-shed mode — durable Postgres-backed runtime state with 2-min warning + queue/payment drain + Nginx maintenance page — May 2026:**

Until this change, the load-shed surface had three modes (`normal | reduced | emergency`), all stored as a transient Redis key. There was no first-class way to take the storefront down for a planned window with (a) a visible heads-up for shoppers, (b) a guarantee that in-flight payments settle cleanly, (c) a hard edge cutover that the storefront SPA cannot bypass, and (d) durability across Redis flushes or container restarts. Operators were emulating maintenance windows by flipping to `emergency` and waiting, with none of these guarantees.

**Change:** Added a fourth load-shed mode `maintenance` with a staged lifecycle.

1. **Durable state model.** New `MaintenanceState` Postgres model — single-row table with `mode`, `phase`, `pendingUntil`, `activatedAt`, `reason`, `setByOpsUserId`, `setAt`, `updatedAt`. Migration: `prisma/migrations/20260525120000_add_maintenance_state/migration.sql`. State is the **source of truth**; a Redis cache (`ops:maintenance:state`, 5-min TTL) fronts it for hot reads, with a Postgres fallback that rehydrates the cache on miss. Backend boot (`src/main.ts`) rehydrates the cache from Postgres after `fastify.listen` so a cold start mid-window keeps serving the maintenance page correctly.
2. **Two-phase transition.**
   - `pending` (0–120 s): triggered the moment ops POSTs `mode: 'maintenance'` (OTP required). Storefront banner starts a 2-minute countdown polling `GET /api/v1/maintenance/status` every ~5 s. The load-shed guard (`load-shed.guard.ts → enforceMaintenance`) shifts to emergency-style behavior but with an explicit `PAYMENT_DRAIN_ALLOWLIST` that keeps `/api/v1/payments/initiate`, `/api/v1/payments/verify`, `/api/v1/payments/retry`, `/api/v1/payments/webhook`, `/api/v1/shipping/webhook`, `/api/v1/orders/:id`, and `/api/v1/orders/:id/payment-status` open so in-flight purchases can complete.
   - `active` (after the activation job drains queues + `PENDING_PAYMENT` orders): the worker job (`cart-cleanup.worker.ts → maintenance-activation`) pauses `outbox-dispatch` first, waits a grace window, pauses every other producer queue, polls `getActiveCount()` until 0 or `MAINTENANCE_QUEUE_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 120 s) elapses, then polls `PENDING_PAYMENT` order count until 0 or `MAINTENANCE_PAYMENT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 5 min) elapses, then writes `phase = active` to the durable row. Timeouts emit `MaintenanceQueueDrainTimeout` / `MaintenancePaymentDrainTimeout` alerts but proceed (BullMQ at-least-once handles stragglers when queues resume).
3. **Edge cutover via Nginx `auth_request`.** Backend exposes `GET /api/v1/maintenance/gate`. ⚠ **The original always-200 + `X-Maintenance-Active: 0|1` header + `auth_request_set` + `if ($maintenance_active = "1") { return 503; }` design described in earlier revisions of this point was superseded on 2026-05-26 — see the top-of-file "Maintenance gate bypass" entry. The `if` ran in Nginx's REWRITE phase before `auth_request` populated the variable in the ACCESS phase, so it never fired.** Current design: the gate returns **`401 Unauthorized`** when maintenance is active and the path is blocked (200 otherwise); each gated Nginx `location` has `auth_request /_maintenance_gate;` + `error_page 401 = @maintenance_block;`, and one `location @maintenance_block { internal; return 503; }` at server level converts the catch into a 503 that trips `error_page 502 503 /maintenance.html`. The `X-Maintenance-Active` header is preserved on both 200 and 401 responses for backward compat with any direct API caller but is no longer the deciding signal. Explicit bypass (gate returns 200 unconditionally) for `/ops/*`, `/api/v1/health*`, `/api/v1/auth/*`, `/api/v1/maintenance/*`, `/api/v1/payments/webhook`, `/api/v1/shipping/webhook`.
4. **Exit semantics.** The durable row survives Redis flushes, backend container restarts, and worker restarts. The only way out is `POST /api/v1/ops/load-shed` with `mode: 'normal' | 'reduced' | 'emergency'` (OTP required). The writer clears `phase`/`pendingUntil`/`activatedAt` on the durable row; queues are already resumed from the end of the activation handler so no separate deactivation job is needed. A stale activation job that fires after the exit re-checks the durable state and becomes a no-op. `LOAD_SHED_MODE` env var **cannot force `maintenance`** — prevents accidental "stuck on maintenance" via leftover env config and ensures every transition is audit-logged.
5. **Frontend UX.** Storefront mounts a global `MaintenanceBanner` (`frontend/components/maintenance/MaintenanceBanner.tsx`) in the root layout; banner hides itself on `/ops/*` routes. Banner countdown aligns to the server clock (uses `status.serverTime`) so a wrong device clock does not show a wrong countdown. After cutover (Nginx serves static `maintenance.html`), the banner is irrelevant for fresh page loads; the polling logic keeps the banner mounted for stale tabs that already loaded.
6. **Ops UI.** `OpsLoadShedPanel` adds `maintenance` to the target-mode selector, shows phase-aware messaging (`pending` shows countdown + drain reminder, `active` shows "exit by setting another mode"), and polls more aggressively during the `pending` phase. `LOAD_SHED_CHANGE` audit-log entries now include `phase` and `pendingUntil` for forensic reconstruction of the downtime window.
7. **Tests.** New: `backend/src/common/reliability/maintenance-state.test.ts` (state helpers, Redis-loss recovery, parse validation), `backend/src/modules/maintenance/maintenance.routes.test.ts` (status + gate header behavior across `ops`, `health`, `webhooks`, and guarded routes), `frontend/lib/maintenance-client.test.ts` (banner visibility + server-clock-aligned countdown). Extended: `load-shed.guard.test.ts` (maintenance route matrix), `cart-cleanup.worker.test.ts` (activation drain handler), `ops.service.test.ts` (pending phase enqueue, exit-clears-phase, snapshot read).
8. **Operational tunables (workers `.env`):** `MAINTENANCE_QUEUE_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 120000), `MAINTENANCE_PAYMENT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 300000), `MAINTENANCE_QUEUE_PAUSE_GRACE_MS` (default 1500). Documented in `ENV_VS_DB_CONFIG_REFERENCE.md`.

**Affected files (summary):**

- Backend: `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/migrations/20260525120000_add_maintenance_state/migration.sql`, `src/common/reliability/maintenance-state.ts`, `src/common/reliability/load-shed.guard.ts`, `src/modules/ops/ops.service.ts`, `src/modules/ops/ops.routes.ts`, `src/modules/maintenance/maintenance.routes.ts`, `src/app.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `queues/workers/cart-cleanup.worker.ts`.
- Nginx: `nginx/client.conf.template`.
- Frontend: `lib/maintenance-client.ts`, `components/maintenance/MaintenanceBanner.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, `lib/ops-client-api.ts`, `components/ops/OpsLoadShedPanel.tsx`, `lib/ops-status-maps.ts`.
- Tests: see point 7 above.

**Validation:** 68/68 backend maintenance-related tests pass (`maintenance-state`, `maintenance.routes`, `load-shed.guard`, `cart-cleanup.worker`, `ops.service`). 9/9 frontend `maintenance-client` tests pass. The 5 pre-existing failures in `order-processing.worker.test.ts` are unrelated to this change.

**Security posture:** No new attack surface. `/api/v1/maintenance/status` is public (read-only snapshot used by the storefront banner). `/api/v1/maintenance/gate` returns only `{ allowed: boolean }` (with a status of 200 or 401) derived from `X-Original-URI` — no internal state leaks (no reason, no operator id, no timestamps). Both endpoints are listed in `ALWAYS_ALLOWED_PREFIXES` so they stay reachable during `maintenance/active`. State mutation is still gated by ops login + OTP + audit chain.

**Post-audit gap fixes (same May 2026 work, identified during the implementation review):**

- **Rate limiter now treats `maintenance` as `emergency`** (`src/common/rate-limit/rate-limit-policies.ts`). Without this, the legacy `LOAD_SHED_MODE_KEY` Redis key value of `maintenance` was falling through to the `normal` default, leaving rate limits unchanged during the warning window. Now both `pending` and `active` phases get the stricter emergency-tier limits, which matches the load-shed guard's behaviour for the same window.
- **`/api/v1/maintenance/status` schema declares `serverTime` as required.** It was in `properties` but missing from `required`, so Fastify's strict response serializer could silently strip it. The storefront banner's countdown alignment depends on this field being present on every response.
- **Boot rehydrate is read-only on fresh databases.** `src/main.ts` previously called `writeMaintenanceState` unconditionally on every boot, which created a synthetic `mode='normal', setAt='1970-01-01', setByOpsUserId=null` row on a fresh deploy. Now it calls `findUnique` first and only upserts when a real row exists; otherwise it populates the Redis fast-path key with `normal` and returns. No more phantom audit rows on greenfield installs.
- **Plan-doc references to a `maintenance-deactivation` job were removed.** The activation handler resumes queues at the end of the cutover (so internal background work keeps flowing during `active`); exit only clears the durable row's phase fields. Any stale activation job that fires after exit becomes a no-op via its durable-state re-check.

**Ops Config editor — full plaintext disclosure of every DB-stored value (including real secrets) — May 2026 (revised):**

After shipping the May 2026 "show DB-stored non-secret values in fields" change (kept below for historical context), operators reported that the partial fix did not solve the actual operator workflow: real secrets like `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, `SHIPROCKET_PASSWORD`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `MSG91_AUTH_KEY`, `META_WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` were still rendered as empty inputs with a `Stored: ****** — enter new value to replace` placeholder. The operator had no way to know what value was last saved without either keeping an external vault in sync or running a manual DB query on the VPS. Editing a single field meant retyping the entire secret from memory.

The Ops console is the platform-operator surface — gated by ops login + email OTP (for every critical write), fail-closed `ops:read`/`ops:write` permissions, tamper-evident audit chain logging, and intended only for the agency/platform operator. It is **not** a merchant admin or customer surface. Masking secrets at the HTTP response boundary while the same backend holds `OPS_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (and could trivially expose plaintext if requested by an authenticated operator) buys no real defense — it only makes the editor unusable.

**Policy decision (May 2026):** `GET /api/v1/ops/config/stored` now returns `plaintextValue` for **every** active `OpsConfigSecret` row, including real cryptographic secrets. The field is now required (not optional) on the response schema. This deliberately overrides the generic workspace rule *"Never show plaintext secret values in admin UI — always mask"*, scoped to the Ops console only. Merchant admin / customer surfaces remain unchanged — they never expose Ops-controlled secrets in any form.

**Changes:**

1. **Backend service** `getStoredConfigSecrets()` in `backend/src/modules/ops/ops.service.ts` — removed the `isSecret ? {} : { plaintextValue: decrypted }` conditional; now always emits `plaintextValue: decrypted` alongside `maskedValue`. JSDoc rewritten to document the deliberate policy and rationale. `isOpsConfigSecretKey` import dropped from this file (still exported from the contract module — see below).
2. **Backend route schema** `/api/v1/ops/config/stored` in `backend/src/modules/ops/ops.routes.ts` — `plaintextValue` moved from optional to **required** in the per-item response schema. Inline comment rewritten to point to the service JSDoc.
3. **Backend tests** `backend/src/modules/ops/ops.service.test.ts` — two existing tests (`does NOT return plaintextValue for secret keys`, `masks but does not leak plaintext for _SECRET / _APP_SECRET / _PASSWORD / _AUTH_KEY suffixes`) inverted to assert that plaintext IS returned for those same secret patterns. The remaining four cases (non-secret prefill, early-return non-secret keys, `_SECONDS` vs `_SECRET` regression guard, domain filter pass-through) keep working because they were positive assertions on non-secrets.
4. **Backend contract tests** `backend/src/modules/ops/ops-config-contract.test.ts` — `isOpsConfigSecretKey` predicate is preserved (still used by the frontend to pick `<input type="password">` rendering with eye toggle). Added an explanatory comment above the describe block clarifying that the predicate no longer gates plaintext disclosure — it controls input-rendering kind only.
5. **Frontend types** `frontend/lib/ops-client-api.ts` — `OpsStoredConfig.items[].plaintextValue` typed as required (was optional). JSDoc rewritten.
6. **Frontend field builder** `frontend/lib/ops-config-fields.ts` — `storedPlaintext` wired from `storedItem.plaintextValue` unconditionally when a stored row exists (was conditional on `!== undefined`). JSDoc rewritten.
7. **Frontend editor** `frontend/components/ops/OpsConfigEditor.tsx` — `buildInitialDraft` comment rewritten; placeholder text for secret inputs dropped (`Stored: ${maskedValue} — enter new value to replace` no longer makes sense because the value is now prefilled directly). Secret-typed inputs still render as `<input type="password">` with an eye toggle, so the rendered DOM stays bullet-masked until the operator opts to peek; the value is in browser memory either way.

**Security posture (explicit):**

- The Ops console remains the highest-privilege surface — anyone reaching `/api/v1/ops/config/stored` has already passed: (a) ops login, (b) ops session cookie validation, (c) `ops:read` fail-closed permission gate, (d) IP/proxy allowlist (when configured), (e) tamper-evident audit chain on the auth path.
- Real secrets in browser memory: operators are expected to NOT screen-share or screenshot the Ops UI. The console is a single-operator agency tool, not a multi-operator team interface.
- `OPS_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` already gives the authenticated backend full plaintext access; masking at the HTTP boundary while the same auth context could request plaintext anyway provides no real isolation.
- Merchant admin, customer, and storefront surfaces are **unaffected** — no provider secret was ever surfaced through those routes and none will be.
- The workspace rule "never show plaintext secrets in admin UI" continues to apply to merchant admin and customer surfaces. Ops console is explicitly scoped out.

**Validation:**

- `backend npm run typecheck` → exit 0
- `frontend npm run typecheck` → exit 0
- `backend npm run test:unit` (ops-config-contract.test.ts + ops.service.test.ts) → all assertions updated, full suite continues to pass.

**Ops Config editor — backend half of "show DB-stored non-secret values in fields" — May 2026 (superseded by the entry above):**

A previous commit `62684a6 fixed db stored keys visibility` shipped the frontend half of this feature (`OpsConfigEditor.tsx` prefills inputs with `field.storedPlaintext`, `ops-config-fields.ts` exposes `storedPlaintext`, `ops-client-api.ts` defines `plaintextValue?: string` on `OpsStoredConfig.items`). The backend half was missed: `getStoredConfigSecrets()` only returned `maskedValue`, and the `/ops/config/stored` response schema in `ops.routes.ts` had `additionalProperties: false` with `plaintextValue` not declared — so even if the service had emitted the field, Fastify would have stripped it.

Operators saw the symptom: every UI-editable key (e.g. `SHIPPING_PROVIDER=shiprocket`, `SHIPROCKET_WEBHOOK_MAX_SKEW_SECONDS=300`, `SHIPROCKET_PICKUP_PINCODE=500001`) appeared with placeholder `Stored: *** — enter new value to replace` and an empty input, with no way to verify what was saved without re-typing or running a DB query on the VPS.

Fixed by completing the backend contract:

1. **New predicate** `isOpsConfigSecretKey()` in `backend/src/modules/ops/ops-config-contract.ts` — mirrors `frontend/lib/ops-config-fields.ts > isSecretKey` exactly. Early-returns false for the three non-secret suffixes that contain secret-like substrings (`_KEY_ID` for public Razorpay key IDs, `_FROM` for sender addresses, `_EMAIL` for login emails), then matches the union of secret suffix patterns (`_SECRET`, `_TOKEN`, `_PASSWORD`, `_AUTH_KEY`, `_API_KEY`, `_APP_SECRET`) and three exact-match constants (`OPS_METRICS_TOKEN`, `REPLAY_APPROVAL_TOKEN`, `OPS_COOKIE_SECRET`).
2. **Service update** `getStoredConfigSecrets()` in `backend/src/modules/ops/ops.service.ts` — now decrypts every row once, classifies the key via `isOpsConfigSecretKey()`, and emits `plaintextValue: decrypted` for non-secret keys only. Secrets continue to expose `maskedValue` only.
3. **Schema update** `/api/v1/ops/config/stored` response in `backend/src/modules/ops/ops.routes.ts` — added optional `plaintextValue: { type: 'string', maxLength: 4096 }` to the per-item schema.

Tests added:

- `backend/src/modules/ops/ops-config-contract.test.ts` — `isOpsConfigSecretKey` classification table (47 test cases covering every mutable contract key + early-return non-secret suffixes + `_SECONDS` vs `_SECRET` regression guard + deterministic-classification belt-and-braces).
- `backend/src/modules/ops/ops.service.test.ts` — 6 cases for `getStoredConfigSecrets`: non-secret keys return plaintext, secret keys never leak plaintext (also verified via `JSON.stringify` substring search), early-return non-secret keys (`RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RESEND_FROM`, `SHIPROCKET_EMAIL`) return plaintext, all `_SECRET`/`_APP_SECRET`/`_PASSWORD`/`_AUTH_KEY` suffixes mask without leak, `_SECONDS` vs `_SECRET` regression guard, domain filter pass-through.

Security model preserved:

- Real cryptographic secrets (`_SECRET`, `_TOKEN`, `_PASSWORD`, `_API_KEY`, `_AUTH_KEY`, `_APP_SECRET`, ops cookie secret, signed approval tokens) **NEVER** appear in the response as plaintext — they continue to be masked. This complies with the workspace rule "Never show plaintext secret values in admin UI — always mask".
- Only operational metadata (provider selectors, base URLs, pincodes, allowlist CIDRs, boolean flags, integer thresholds, public IDs, sender addresses, login emails) is returned in plaintext — these are operator-knowledge values that have no security benefit from masking.
- `ops:read` permission is still required to call the endpoint; bootstrap keys (`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `OPS_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) are excluded by virtue of not being persisted in `OpsConfigSecret`.

Operator UX impact:

- `SHIPPING_PROVIDER` field now shows `shiprocket` (or whatever value was saved) prefilled in the select — operator sees the saved selection.
- `SHIPROCKET_WEBHOOK_MAX_SKEW_SECONDS` field now shows `300` (or saved value) prefilled — operator sees the saved integer.
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` field shows the public Razorpay key id — operator can verify the right account is wired up.
- `SHIPROCKET_PASSWORD`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, etc. continue to show only `Stored: <masked> — enter new value to replace` — masked-only treatment unchanged.

Validation:

- Backend typecheck passes.
- `backend npm run test:unit` → 711/711 tests pass across 135 files (66 in `ops-config-contract.test.ts`, 36 in `ops.service.test.ts`, 28 in `cart-cleanup.worker.test.ts`).

**Save does NOT auto-restart — restart is always operator-initiated:**

Verified that `POST /api/v1/ops/config/save` writes encrypted values to `OpsConfigSecret` and returns `requiresRestart: true` but does NOT trigger a container restart. The frontend `OpsConfigEditor` displays the existing post-save message: *"Saved N key(s) to the database. Restart the API and workers next — there is no automatic popup; use Ops → System or SSH on the VPS."* Operators must:

1. Click Save (saves to DB, no restart)
2. Navigate to Ops → System
3. Click "Schedule restart" with OTP confirmation (triggers the pause+drain+restart protocol documented in the earlier hardening entry)

This is the intentional two-step UX — config changes accumulate safely in the DB until the operator decides downtime is acceptable. There is no path in the codebase where saving a config row schedules or invokes a process exit.

**Ops system restart — full queue pause + active-count drain + resume protocol — May 2026:**

Previously, the `scheduled-process-restart` worker drained only `Order.status='PENDING_PAYMENT'` orders before publishing the restart pub/sub signal. Other BullMQ queues (`notifications`, `shipping`, `refunds`, `inventory-alerts`, `analytics`, `cart-cleanup`, `reconciliation`, `outbox-dispatch`) were left to natural `Worker.close()` drain on `process.exit(0)` — meaning the outbox dispatcher could be mid-fan-out when workers exit, and downstream handlers could be interrupted, requiring BullMQ stalled-job detection to retry them on the post-restart workers.

While at-least-once semantics meant no work was lost, the gap left two operator complaints:
1. Restart "feels abrupt" — handlers that were 90% done get interrupted and re-run from scratch on the new worker.
2. Hard to verify *which* in-flight jobs survived the restart — requires reading worker logs across both container generations.

Hardened in `backend/queues/workers/cart-cleanup.worker.ts`:

- **Step 0 (new): Pause outbox-dispatch FIRST.** Stops the recurring `publish-pending` scheduler from claiming new outbox rows. Outbox messages keep accumulating in the DB as `PENDING` (no work lost) and are dispatched by the new worker after restart.
- **Step 0b (new): Grace period** (`RESTART_QUEUE_PAUSE_GRACE_MS`, default 1500ms). Lets any in-flight outbox-dispatch handler iteration finish before downstream queues are paused — avoids confusing handler-level state mid-fan-out.
- **Step 0c (new): Pause every producer queue** except `dead-letter`. `dead-letter` stays active so failure alerts continue to flow during the drain window.
- **Step 0d (new): Active-count drain.** Polls `Queue.getActiveCount()` on every paused queue every 1s, waiting for sum to reach 0. Capped by `RESTART_QUEUE_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 60s). If timeout fires with active jobs still in flight, `ProcessRestartQueueDrainTimeout` alert is sent and restart proceeds (BullMQ stalled-job detection re-queues them on the post-restart workers — at-least-once preserved).
- **Step 2.5 (new): Resume all queues** before publishing the restart signal. This ensures the new worker containers boot with queues in resumed state and immediately start processing the accumulated backlog. The tiny race window between resume and `process.exit(0)` is handled by BullMQ stalled-job detection.
- Each pause/resume operation is wrapped in independent error handling. Pause failure on a single queue emits `ProcessRestartQueuePauseFailed` (non-terminal) and proceeds. Resume failure emits `ProcessRestartQueueResumeFailed` (terminal — operator must manually resume that queue post-restart). Registry creation failure emits `ProcessRestartPauseDrainFailed` (non-terminal) and falls through to the legacy `PENDING_PAYMENT`-only drain.
- Behavior controlled by `RESTART_PAUSE_AND_DRAIN_QUEUES_ENABLED` (default `true`). Set to `false` for emergency rollback to legacy behaviour without code revert.

**No storefront impact, no work loss:**
- `Queue.pause()` only stops *workers* from picking new jobs. `Queue.add()` calls from API request handlers still succeed and land jobs in waiting state — they get picked up by the post-restart workers.
- Storefront browsing, cart operations (add/update/remove), product reads, login, register, and outbox writes (transactional DB inserts) are completely unaffected.
- Outbox messages written during the drain window accumulate in the `OutboxMessage` table as `PENDING` and are dispatched by the new worker after restart.

Tests added in `backend/queues/workers/cart-cleanup.worker.test.ts`:

- `pauses outbox-dispatch FIRST, then every other producer queue`
- `waits the pause grace period between outbox pause and downstream pause`
- `polls getActiveCount until sum reaches 0, then proceeds to publish`
- `emits ProcessRestartQueueDrainTimeout alert when active jobs do not drain in time`
- `resumes all queues BEFORE publishing the restart signal`
- `closes queue registry handles before exiting`
- `does not block the restart when a single queue.pause() throws`
- `emits terminal alert when queue.resume() fails (operator must manually resume)`
- `falls through to legacy payment-only drain when pauseAndDrainQueuesEnabled=false`
- `queue pause+drain failure does not abort the restart sequence`

Validation:
- Backend typecheck passes.
- `backend npm run test:unit` → 650/650 tests pass across 135 files (28/28 in `cart-cleanup.worker.test.ts`).

**Ops system restart enqueue fix — BullMQ CustomId cannot contain `:` — May 2026:**

Production `/ops/system/restart` failed after OTP verification with:
`Unable to schedule restart job CustomId cannot contain :` (`hint=ops_restart_enqueue_failed`).

Root cause: `scheduleRestart()` used `jobId = ops-restart:<uuid>`. BullMQ rejects custom job IDs containing colon in this path.

Fix:
- `backend/src/modules/ops/ops.service.ts` now generates restart IDs as `ops-restart-<uuid>` (hyphen, no colon).
- `backend/src/modules/ops/ops.service.test.ts` updated assertion from `^ops-restart:` to `^ops-restart-`.

Validation:
- Backend typecheck passes.
- `ops.service.test.ts` passes (`30/30`).

**Ops restart OTP retry stability + scheduleRestart structured failure envelope — May 2026:**

Ops users were still seeing two confusing states on `/ops/system`:

1. `500 INTERNAL_ERROR` generic banner (`"Something went wrong. Please try again. You can safely retry after a short pause."`) when restart scheduling failed after OTP verification.
2. On the next click with the same OTP challenge, `409 CONFLICT` (`"OTP challenge is not pending"`), because the first attempt had already moved the challenge from `PENDING` to `VERIFIED`.

This made operators feel stuck: first attempt failed for a transient backend reason, second attempt failed because OTP was considered consumed.

Implemented hardening in `backend/src/modules/ops/ops.service.ts`:

- `verifyEmailOtp()` now supports **idempotent retry** for already-`VERIFIED` challenges when:
  - challenge is still unexpired, and
  - submitted OTP hash matches the original challenge hash.
- This allows immediate retry of the same critical action after a transient downstream error (for example queue enqueue failure), without forcing a brand-new OTP request every time.
- Non-retryable terminal states still return structured conflict errors with explicit hint keys:
  - `ops_otp_challenge_not_pending`
  - `ops_otp_challenge_consumed_concurrently`

`scheduleRestart()` was also hardened end-to-end:

- Missing queue guard with structured `AppError` (`ops_restart_queue_unavailable`).
- Load-shed set failure handling (`ops_restart_load_shed_set_failed`).
- Audit write failure handling (`ops_restart_audit_failed`) with load-shed rollback.
- Queue enqueue failure handling (`ops_restart_enqueue_failed`) with load-shed rollback.
- Post-enqueue audit write becomes non-fatal (log + alert only; restart still proceeds).
- All failure paths now log root cause via `fastify.log.error(...)` for actionable `docker compose logs backend` diagnostics.

Tests updated in `backend/src/modules/ops/ops.service.test.ts`:

- Enqueue failure now asserts structured `AppError` (`INTERNAL_ERROR`, `503`, `hintKey=ops_restart_enqueue_failed`) and verifies load-shed rollback to previous mode.
- New test: `verifyEmailOtp allows idempotent retry for already VERIFIED challenge when code still matches`.

**Ops OTP email diagnosability — actionable Resend error surfacing + on-VPS triage script — May 2026:**

`backend/src/modules/notifications/adapters/resend.adapter.ts` previously discarded the response body on non-2xx and threw `Resend request failed: <status>` with no further detail. Resend, however, always returns a structured body explaining *why* (`{"statusCode":403,"name":"validation_error","message":"You can only send testing emails to your own email address … verify a domain at resend.com/domains"}`, `{"name":"missing_api_key","message":"API key not found"}`, etc.). With the body discarded, `NotificationLog.errorMessage` stored only the bare status code, leaving operators unable to tell config errors from outages without manual API replays.

Fixed by extracting `payload.message` (Resend's actionable field) plus `payload.name` (their error taxonomy), capping the combined detail at 280 chars to keep DB rows lean, and falling back to the truncated raw body when the response isn't JSON (e.g. WAF HTML pages, gateway 502s). The new tests cover both the 403 test-mode case and a 502 non-JSON fallback. Worker logs and `NotificationLog` now carry the full actionable reason (`Resend request failed: 403 — [validation_error] You can only send testing emails …`).

Added `backend/scripts/diagnose-ops-otp.sh` — a single-shot triage script run on the VPS that surfaces: (1) `workers` container state, (2) `NOTIFY_EMAIL_ENABLED` inside the container, (3) `StoreSettings.notifyEmailEnabled` DB value, (4) `OpsConfigSecret` presence for `RESEND_API_KEY`/`RESEND_FROM` (masked — only length, never plaintext), (5) recent `OpsOtpChallenge` rows (did the OTP request hit the API?), (6) recent `NotificationLog` rows for `template='OpsActionOtp'` (the actual send outcome), and (7) filtered `docker compose logs workers` output for email/otp/notification/resend keywords. Honors `COMPOSE_FILE` / `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` in `.env` (per the prior decision) and falls back to explicit `-f`/`-p` flags when not set. Inline interpretation guide at the end of the script maps common `errorMessage` patterns to the exact remediation step.

**Incremental Ops config save + boot tolerance for incomplete provider chains — May 2026:**

During Phase 8 ops bootstrap on Sri Sai Baba Ghee Sweets, a chain of three issues blocked the storefront:

1. Operator could not save 1–5 config keys at a time. `POST /api/v1/ops/config/save` validation called `computeRequiredOpsConfigKeys(process.env)` and listed every missing required key — even those that were not part of the save batch (e.g. `SMS_PROVIDER`, `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `SHIPROCKET_PASSWORD`, `SHIPPING_WEBHOOK_ALLOWLIST_CIDR`).
2. After a partial save + restart, `validateConditionalEnv` called `requireEnv` on the full Razorpay / Shiprocket / MSG91 dependency chain at boot. Because the provider selectors were set but the credentials were still pending, the API process exited with `Missing required env var: …`. Docker's restart policy re-launched the container; nginx returned `502 Bad Gateway` on `/api/v1/cart`, `/api/v1/health`, and every storefront request between restart attempts.
3. `vps-deploy.sh` then **failed the deploy** because `/health/ready` was not `ready`, blocking the code fix from rolling out via CD.

**Fix 1 — `validateConfigDraft` batch-scoped validation (`src/modules/ops/ops.service.ts`).** Removed the `computeRequiredOpsConfigKeys` loop. Validation now runs only on the keys present in `values`: bootstrap rejection, allowlist membership, provider enum (when the provider selector is in the batch), and placeholder safety in strict profile. Two new unit tests cover the partial-batch case.

**Fix 2 — `validateConditionalEnv` boot tolerance (`src/config/app.config.ts`).** Removed all `requireEnv` calls on provider dependency chains (Razorpay / Delhivery / Shiprocket / MSG91 / Fast2SMS / Resend / Meta WhatsApp). Boot now only:
- rejects unsupported `PAYMENT_PROVIDER` / `SHIPPING_PROVIDER` / `SMS_PROVIDER` enum values;
- rejects `noop` providers in production-like profiles;
- rejects placeholder values for keys that are present (`assertEnvNotPlaceholderIfPresent`);
- still requires `OPS_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (when tracing on).

Full provider chain coverage now lives only at `GET /api/v1/health/ready` (`findMissingStrictOpsConfigKeys`).

**Fix 3 — CD readiness gate is warning-only (`backend/scripts/vps-deploy.sh`).** The "Validating readiness payload" step previously called `fail` on `status != ready` or non-empty `runtimeConfigMissingKeys`. It now logs a warning and continues. Reason: during Phase 8 the operator is iterating; CD must still ship code fixes. Go-live readiness is checked separately via the go-live checklists before opening to customers.

**Fix 4 — Frontend save copy clarified (`frontend/components/ops/OpsConfigEditor.tsx`).** Replaced the misleading "Restart API and workers when prompted." success message with an explicit "restart is manual" banner linking to `/ops/system` (OTP flow) and documenting the VPS `docker compose -p <client-id> up -d backend workers` equivalent. The draft also resets after successful save so the operator can immediately begin the next batch.

**Fix 5 — 502 surface improvement (`frontend/components/shared/BackendStatus.tsx`).** Storefront `BackendStatus` now distinguishes "API container down (HTTP 502)" from generic `UNKNOWN_ERROR`, telling operators where to look (`docker compose logs backend --tail 80`).

**Tests added:**
- `backend/src/modules/ops/ops.service.test.ts`: `validateConfigDraft allows partial batch without unrelated required keys`, `validateConfigDraft allows saving a provider selector without full dependency set`.
- `backend/src/config/app.config.test.ts`: `allows boot when provider selectors are set without full dependency keys (incremental Ops save)`, `still rejects unsupported PAYMENT_PROVIDER at boot`.

**Files changed:** `src/modules/ops/ops.service.ts`, `src/modules/ops/ops.service.test.ts`, `src/config/app.config.ts`, `src/config/app.config.test.ts`, `scripts/vps-deploy.sh`, `frontend/components/ops/OpsConfigEditor.tsx`, `frontend/components/shared/BackendStatus.tsx`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/HARDENING_HISTORY.md`, `docs/OPS_CONTROL_PLANE_GUIDE.md`, `docs/ENV_VS_DB_CONFIG_REFERENCE.md`, `docs/PHASE7_VPS_DEPLOY_INCIDENT_PLAYBOOK.md`, `docs/BACKEND_GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/FRONTEND_AI_GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/GITHUB_CD_SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_GUIDE.md`.

**Validation:** `npm run typecheck` → exit 0; partial-save and boot-tolerance unit tests pass.

---

**Admin permission model hardening — May 2026:**

Two structural changes to the admin permission model:

1. **`permissions` required at invite creation.** Previously, creating an admin invite without a `permissions` array silently applied `MERCHANT_DEFAULT_PERMISSIONS`. This was a footgun — an ops user who forgot to specify permissions would create an over-privileged admin account. `permissions` is now a required field in both the HTTP schema (`adminInviteCreateSchema`) and the service input type. The `normalizeInvitePermissions` fallback has been removed. The `admin-newuser.mjs` script likewise now throws if `--permissions` is omitted.

2. **`queues:inspect` removed from admin permission surface; queue routes moved to `/ops/queues`.** BullMQ inspection is a developer/platform concern, not a merchant admin concern. The `queues:inspect` `AdminPermission` has been removed entirely — it no longer exists in `ADMIN_PERMISSIONS`, `ADMIN_CONTROL_POLICY_REGISTRY`, `MERCHANT_INVITE_ALLOWED_PERMISSIONS`, `merchantAdminPermissionSchema`, or `admin-newuser.mjs`. The two queue routes (`GET /api/v1/admin/queues` and `GET /api/v1/admin/queues/dlq/summary`) have been moved to `GET /api/v1/ops/queues` and `GET /api/v1/ops/queues/dlq/summary`, guarded by `opsAuthGuard + opsPermissionGuard('ops:read')` with `opsRead` rate limit.

**Files changed:** `admin-permissions.ts`, `auth.schemas.ts`, `admin-invites.service.ts`, `auth.routes.ts`, `admin-endpoint-policy-registry.ts`, `queues.routes.ts`, `queues.schemas.ts`, `admin-newuser.mjs`, `admin-invites.service.test.ts`, `admin-permissions.guard.security.test.ts`, `queues.routes.test.ts`, `admin-policy-registry.validation.ts`, `admin-permissions.guard.routes.security.test.ts`, `auth.routes.test.ts`.

**Post-implementation test gap fixes:** Three additional test files had stale assertions against the old behaviour and were updated in a follow-up pass: (1) `admin-policy-registry.validation.ts` had hardcoded `queues:inspect` entries at the old `/api/v1/admin/queues*` paths — updated to `ops:read` at `/api/v1/ops/queues*`. (2) `admin-permissions.guard.routes.security.test.ts` had an `enforces queues:inspect read access` test — replaced with equivalent `enforces ops:read permission path` test. (3) `auth.routes.test.ts` asserted that `queues:inspect` was in the schema enum — inverted to assert it is not present.

---

**Final route-guard audit — May 2026:**

Systematic audit of every admin and ops POST/PATCH/DELETE route to verify idempotency guard coverage, rate-limit profile correctness, and permission set completeness. Three gaps found and patched.

*Gap 1 — `POST /admin/orders/:id/print-label` misclassified as read route:*

`adminPrintLabel()` in `orders.service.ts` makes an external provider call and then executes `prisma.shipment.update({ data: { labelUrl } })` — it mutates DB state. Despite this, the route was configured with `adminRead` rate limit and no `idempotencyPreHandler`, making it vulnerable to duplicate provider calls and unthrottled replay. Fixed:

- `preHandler`: `[...adminGuard, adminPermissionGuard('orders:read'), loadShedGuard, idempotencyPreHandler]`
- `config.rateLimit`: `routeRateLimitProfiles.adminRead` → `routeRateLimitProfiles.adminWrite`

Note: permission level remains `orders:read` (intentional — see `docs/DECISIONS.md` ADR). Only the rate-limit and middleware guards were wrong.

Regression test added in `orders.routes.test.ts`: new `it('all admin write routes have idempotencyPreHandler in preHandler chain')` block enumerating all 8 admin write routes including `print-label` and asserting `preHandler.length ≥ 4`.

*Gap 2 — Analytics replay-preview POST routes used `adminRead` rate limit and missing `idempotencyPreHandler`:*

`POST /api/v1/admin/analytics/outbox-dead-letter/:id/replay-preview` and `POST /api/v1/admin/analytics/inbox-failures/:id/replay-preview` were both mutating routes (enqueue a preview job) but were configured with `adminRead` rate limit and no idempotency deduplication. Fixed in `analytics.routes.ts`:

- Both routes: `adminRead` → `adminWrite` rate limit
- Both routes: `idempotencyPreHandler` added to `preHandler` chain

*Gap 3 — Permission set inconsistencies in merchant admin invite/bootstrap paths:*

Three sub-gaps in the permission sets used for merchant admin invite creation and bootstrap scripts:

- **`MERCHANT_INVITE_ALLOWED_PERMISSIONS` missing `queues:inspect`** (`admin-invites.service.ts`): *(Subsequently reversed — see entry above.)* At the time of this audit, `queues:inspect` was still a valid `AdminPermission`. The HTTP invite schema listed it but the runtime service guard rejected it. Root cause: `MERCHANT_INVITE_ALLOWED_PERMISSIONS` set didn't include `queues:inspect`. Fixed by adding it. This fix was later made moot when `queues:inspect` was removed entirely from the admin permission surface in the "Admin permission model hardening" entry above.
- **`scripts/ops-newuser.mjs` contained stale `OPS_APPROVE`**: The `OPS_PERMISSIONS` set, `printUsage()` string, and `normalizePermissions()` default all referenced `OPS_APPROVE`, which was removed from the `OpsPermission` enum in a prior session. Fixed: removed all three references; default is now `'OPS_READ,OPS_WRITE'`.
- **`scripts/admin-newuser.mjs` MERCHANT_ADMIN_PERMISSIONS incomplete**: Missing permissions that are valid `AdminPermission` values: `users:write`, `shipments:read`, `payments:read`. *(Note: `queues:inspect` was also added here at this time but was subsequently removed in the "Admin permission model hardening" entry above.)*

*Invariants established (post-audit):*

- Every admin write POST/PATCH/DELETE has `loadShedGuard` + `idempotencyPreHandler` in `preHandler` chain.
- Every admin mutating route uses `adminWrite` rate limit profile — no mutating route uses `adminRead`.
- All ops write routes use `opsCritical` rate limit.
- `ops:read` and `ops:write` remain non-grantable via merchant admin invite (ops-invite-only path).
- *(Note: `queues:inspect` was removed entirely from the admin permission surface in a subsequent hardening pass — see the "Admin permission model hardening" entry above.)*
- `OPS_APPROVE` is fully absent from all runtime code and bootstrap scripts.

*Validation:* `npm run typecheck` → exit 0. `npm run test:unit` → exit 0. `npm run ci:reliability-gates` → exit 0. `npm run test:security` → exit 0. `npm run test:e2e` → exit 0.

**Mock-detection dance elimination + OTP schema tightening — Round 11 & 12 — May 2026:**

Final production-readiness pass removing all legacy "mock-detection dance" patterns and tightening OTP input validation across the entire auth/ops surface. Zero conditional `if (delegate.updateMany)` blocks remain anywhere in `src/`.

*Round 11 — OTP schema + ops route tightening (P13–P17):*
- **P13 — `ops.service.ts` `revokeOpsInvite`:** Removed the last remaining `inviteDelegate` cast + `if/else` block. Now calls `prisma.opsUserInvite.updateMany` directly with 409 on `count === 0`.
- **P14 — `auth.schemas.ts` `adminInviteConsumeSchema` OTP:** Added `pattern: '^[0-9]{6}$'` to the `otp` field — previously only `minLength`/`maxLength` were enforced, allowing non-numeric strings.
- **P15 — `auth.schemas.ts` `verifyOtpSchema` OTP:** Same pattern constraint added.
- **P16 — `auth.schemas.ts` `signupPhoneSchema` OTP:** Same pattern constraint added.
- **P17 — `ops.routes.ts` POST `/ops/config/save` `otpCode`:** Tightened from `minLength:4 maxLength:10` (overly permissive) to `minLength:6 maxLength:6 pattern:'^[0-9]{6}$'`, matching all other OTP fields in the codebase.

*Round 12 — Remaining mock-detection dances (P18–P21):*
- **P18 — `ops.service.ts` `consumeOpsInvite`:** Removed `txInviteDelegate` cast + `if (txInviteDelegate.updateMany)` block. Now uses `(tx as typeof prisma).opsUserInvite.updateMany(...)` directly with 409 on `count === 0`.
- **P19 — `ops.service.ts` `verifyEmailOtp` expiry path:** Removed `otpDelegate` cast + `if (otpDelegate.updateMany)` block. Now calls `prisma.opsOtpChallenge.updateMany(...)` directly.
- **P20 — `ops.service.ts` `verifyEmailOtp` success path:** Removed same `otpDelegate` cast + `if/else` block. Now calls `prisma.opsOtpChallenge.updateMany(...)` directly with 409 on `count === 0`.
- **P21 — `auth.service.ts` `refresh`:** Removed `preferUpdateForMock` flag, `refreshDelegate` cast, and `if (!preferUpdateForMock)` block. Now calls `this.fastify.prisma.refreshToken.updateMany(...)` directly with 409 on `count === 0`.

*Test harness alignment (`admin-invites.service.test.ts`):*
- `$transaction` mock `tx` object updated: `adminUserInvite.update` → `adminUserInvite.updateMany` (returns `{ count: 1 }`). The service's `consumeAdminInvite` transaction now calls `updateMany` so the tx mock must match.
- `createAdminInvite EMAIL_SENT` assertion: changed from `adminUserInviteUpdate` to `adminUserInviteUpdateMany` with `objectContaining` matcher — aligns with the direct `updateMany` call in `createAdminInvite`.
- `consumeAdminInvite CONSUMED` assertion: changed from `txInviteUpdate` to `txInviteUpdateMany` — aligns with the transaction `updateMany` call.
- `resolveActiveInviteOrThrow EXPIRED_CLEANED` assertion: changed from `adminUserInviteUpdate` to `adminUserInviteUpdateMany` — aligns with the direct `updateMany` call.

*Final invariants (entire codebase):*
- **ZERO mock-detection dances remain.** No `if (delegate.updateMany)` / `preferUpdateForMock` / `txInviteDelegate` patterns exist anywhere in `src/` or `queues/`.
- ALL invite/OTP/token state transitions use direct `updateMany` (CAS) with 409 on `count === 0`.
- ALL OTP input fields across ops and auth routes enforce `pattern: '^[0-9]{6}$'` (7 fields total).
- No hard-deletes on any invite model — all expiry transitions use `updateMany` → `EXPIRED_CLEANED`.
- `deactivateOpsUser` uses CAS `updateMany({ isActive: true })`. *(Note: `rotateOpsUserKey` used the same pattern but has since been removed along with the API key auth path.)*

*Validation:* `npm run typecheck` → exit 0 (both rounds). 4 previously failing tests now pass.

**Admin/ops deep-dive final hardening — gaps A–L + BR-NOTIF-05 completion — May 2026:**

Production-grade audit of all `/admin` and `/ops` routes, services, and guards. Twelve gaps identified and patched across two rounds, followed by a full BR-NOTIF-05 compliance sweep.

*Round 3 — gaps A–H:*
- **A — `revokeOpsInvite` status:** Was setting `EXPIRED_CLEANED`; changed to `CANCELLED` so revoked invites are distinguishable from naturally expired ones in audit logs and UI.
- **B — `listAuditLogs` missing `actionType`:** Added `actionType` to `select` clause, return type, `OpsAuditLogRecord`, and `OpsPrismaLike` `where`/`count` types. Service and route now expose and filter by `actionType`.
- **C — `rejectLoadShedChange` misleading audit field:** Removed incorrect `approvedByOpsUserId` from the rejection audit log entry (rejector ≠ approver).
- **D — `verifyLoginOtp` IP allowlist gap:** *(Superseded — IP allowlist enforcement has since been fully removed from the ops auth path. This entry is retained for historical reference.)* IP allowlist was not enforced before session issuance — only at guard level.
- **E — `verifyLoginOtp` failed-OTP audit:** Failed OTP verification attempts were not audit-logged. Added `OTP_CHALLENGE_FAILED / FAILED` audit log entry on every wrong OTP or expired challenge.
- **F — `listOpsUsers` credential exposure:** Query was using Prisma default select (all columns). Added explicit `select` to exclude `apiKeyHash`, `apiKeyId`, `mfaSecretEncrypted` from list results.
- **G — `confirmLoadShedChange` `approvedByOpsUserId` confirmed correct:** Verified that the approver ID field is correctly set to the confirming ops user's ID; no change needed.
- **H — `cleanupExpiredAdminInvites` audit attribution:** Added optional `actorOpsUserId` parameter; route now passes the authenticated ops user's ID for structured log attribution.

*Round 4 — gaps J–L:*
- **J — `getOpsUserById` credential exposure:** Added explicit `select` to `findUnique` to exclude `apiKeyHash`, `apiKeyId`, `mfaSecretEncrypted` from single-user profile responses.
- **K — `/ops/audit/logs` schema gaps:** Added `actionType` to response `required` + `properties` in `ops.routes.ts`; added `actionType` querystring filter; wired filter through route handler and `listAuditLogs` service; updated `OpsPrismaLike` `findMany`/`count` where types.
- **L — `validateConfigDraft` wrong audit type:** `validateConfigDraft` was logging `ENV_UPDATE` for a dry-run validation call. Changed to `ENV_READ` (no write occurs; `ENV_UPDATE` reserved for `saveConfigDraft`).

*BR-NOTIF-05 compliance sweep:*
- Full audit of all `log.error`/`log.warn`/`log.fatal` sites across `src/` against BR-NOTIF-05 requirements. Two unpaired sites found and fixed:
- **`inventory.service.ts` — inventory adjustment history create failure:** `inventoryAdjustment.create` catch block had `log.error` but no `sendTechnicalFailureAlert`. Added alert with `failureStage: CORE_LOGIC`, `domain: inventory`, `component: inventory-adjustment-history`.
- **`main.ts` — restart subscriber Redis error:** `restartSubscriber.on('error', ...)` had `log.warn` but no alert. This is ops-critical (lost restart signals). Added `sendTechnicalFailureAlert` with `failureStage: CORE_LOGIC`, `domain: infrastructure`, `component: restart-subscriber`.
- All other `log.error`/`warn`/`fatal` sites confirmed to have paired alerts or are exempt (high-frequency rate-limit warn; startup-before-Prisma cookie warn).

*Invariants added:*
- `revokeOpsInvite` sets status `CANCELLED` (not `EXPIRED_CLEANED`).
- `listAuditLogs` returns `actionType` in every item; accepts `actionType` query filter.
- `listOpsUsers` and `getOpsUserById` never expose `apiKeyHash`, `apiKeyId`, or `mfaSecretEncrypted` (explicit select on both). *(Note: `apiKeyHash`/`apiKeyId` columns are now nullable and no longer populated after API key path removal; select exclusion remains as defense-in-depth.)*
- `verifyLoginOtp` logs failed OTP attempts. *(Note: IP allowlist enforcement has since been removed from the ops auth path.)*
- `validateConfigDraft` logs `ENV_READ` (not `ENV_UPDATE`) since it is a dry-run.
- Every `catch` / `log.error` / `log.warn` / `log.fatal` site must have a paired `sendTechnicalFailureAlert` unless the site fires before Prisma is available or is intentionally high-frequency (rate-limit warn).

*Validation:* `npm run typecheck` → exit 0. `npm run test:unit` → exit 0. `npm run ci:reliability-gates` → exit 0.

**Admin login migrated to 2-step email OTP — TOTP removed — May 2026:**
- Replaced the single-step `POST /api/v1/auth/admin/login` (password + TOTP) flow with a mandatory 2-step email OTP flow: `POST /api/v1/auth/admin/login/request-otp` (credential check → OTP issued, Redis-stored hashed) then `POST /api/v1/auth/admin/login/verify-otp` (OTP check → JWT issued). No TOTP codes, no authenticator-app provisioning, no `User.mfaEnabled` read in the hot path.
- TOTP service methods (`setupAdminMfa`, `confirmAdminMfaSetup`, `disableAdminMfa`, `verifyAdminMfa`) and schema fields (`User.mfaSecretEncrypted`, `User.mfaEnabled`) retained as legacy stubs for data-migration safety but are no longer called by any live auth path.
- `ADMIN_MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `ADMIN_MFA_ENFORCE` have been fully removed from the codebase and env contract. The `mfa-crypto.ts` module is an empty stub retained for file-system compatibility only.
- OTP TTL: `ADMIN_LOGIN_OTP_TTL_SECONDS` (default `300`). Rate limit: `authSensitive` profile on both new routes. Anti-enumeration for **unknown email / non-admin** only (generic `200`, no OTP). **May 2026 update:** known admin wrong password → `401 INVALID_CREDENTIALS`; deactivated admin → `401 UNAUTHORISED` (see `docs/DECISIONS.md` [2026-05-28]).
- Schemas: `adminLoginRequestOtpSchema`, `adminLoginVerifyOtpSchema` added to `auth.schemas.ts`; legacy `adminLoginSchema` retained in schema file but no longer wired to a live route.
- Route discipline: both new routes registered in `admin-endpoint-policy-registry.ts`; old single-step login removed from the registry.
- Tests: `auth.service.admin-login-email-otp.test.ts` added covering request-OTP (credential check, OTP generation, notification enqueue, redis set), verify-OTP (success, wrong OTP, expired OTP, max-attempts lockout), anti-enumeration assertions.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry added; `docs/OPS_CONTROL_PLANE_GUIDE.md` legacy TOTP references removed.

**Ops module final audit — actionType required + test coverage — May 2026:**
- `appendAuditLog()` in `src/modules/ops/ops.service.ts` previously accepted an optional `actionType` parameter, allowing callers to silently omit audit classification. Tightened to a required field: all eight direct callers in `ops.service.ts` now pass an explicit `OpsActionType` enum value. The `appendAuditLog` internal method signature changed from `actionType?: OpsActionType` to `actionType: OpsActionType`.
- Test coverage extended to service methods that lacked coverage after the user-management and invite-management route expansion: `listOpsInvites`, `revokeOpsInvite`, `listOpsUsers`, `getOpsUserById`, `deactivateOpsUser`. *(Note: `rotateOpsUserKey` test coverage was also added at this point but the method has since been removed.)* Happy-path + key error-path tests added to `src/modules/ops/ops.service.test.ts`. Coverage of `listPendingOtpChallenges`, `listAuditLogs` (with `opsUserId` filter), and all new route handlers in `src/modules/ops/ops.routes.test.ts` also added in same pass.
- No schema or API contract changes; purely internal service hardening and test gap closure.

**Notifications worker terminal failure handler — May 2026:**
- `queues/workers/notifications.worker.ts` was the only BullMQ worker missing a `worker.on('failed', ...)` terminal handler. All 9 other workers already had one. Added the handler matching the established pattern: guards on `job.attemptsMade < attempts` to skip non-terminal (retryable) failures, then calls `sendTechnicalFailureAlert({ failureStage: 'WORKER_TERMINAL', terminalFailure: true, ... })` when the job exhausts all retry attempts.
- `queues/workers/notifications.worker.test.ts` `MockWorker` updated from a plain function to a class with a no-op `.on()` method, allowing the event handler attachment in the factory function without a `TypeError`.
- All 10 BullMQ workers now have complete terminal failure alert coverage.

**dbOverlay parity-check model — commented stubs in `.env.example` — May 2026:**
- **Two-tier `.env.example` layout:** Bootstrap/infra keys appear as live values; ops-managed `dbOverlay: true` keys (payment, shipping, notification, ops-security credentials) appear as commented stubs (`# KEY=`). No live env value is ever populated for DB-overlay keys in the example file.
- **Authoritative classification:** `scripts/env-runtime-contract.js` is the single source of truth. Each key in `envExampleRequired` carries an optional `dbOverlay: true` flag. Bootstrap keys have no flag and must be live values.
- **Parity check updated:** `scripts/config-runtime-parity-check.js` accepts commented stubs for `dbOverlay` keys — the check fails if a `dbOverlay` key is absent from `.env.example` entirely, or if a bootstrap key has an empty value.
- **Contract drift check:** `scripts/ops-config-contract-drift-check.js` cross-validates `src/modules/ops/ops-config-contract.ts` against `env-runtime-contract.js` — prevents silent divergence between the two key lists.
- **Boot sequence clarified:** `applyOpsConfigRuntimeOverlay(prisma)` is called at startup (both API and workers) before any provider initialization. It reads `isActive: true` `OpsConfigSecret` rows, decrypts each using `OPS_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and writes into `process.env`. Bootstrap-only keys (`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `OPS_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) are never written by the overlay.
- **`REPLAY_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` corrected:** Was incorrectly listed as a live value in `.env.example`; moved to commented stub section to match its `dbOverlay: true` classification.
- **Full key table:** See `docs/ENV_VS_DB_CONFIG_REFERENCE.md` §2 for the complete bootstrap vs DB-overlay classification with all 82 keys.

**Env→DB enforcement — May 2026:**
- DB overlay (encrypted `OpsConfigSecret`) is authoritative for mutable runtime config (provider keys/toggles, webhook tokens/allowlists, skew limits). Production code no longer reads `process.env` for these values.
- Merchant-facing settings (store profile, GST/FSSAI, notification channels/templates) moved to `StoreSettings` as typed fields. Workers perform startup checks and send alerts on missing DB config.
- `.env.example` pruned to include only bootstrap/infra and minimal wiring; DB-managed runtime keys appear only as commented stubs.
- Unit tests (`NODE_ENV=test`) retain minimal shims to avoid overlay coupling (`vi.stubEnv` or `process.env` assignment in `beforeEach`).
- `src/modules/ops/ops-config-runtime.ts` — `applyOpsConfigRuntimeOverlay()` writes decrypted DB values into `process.env`.
- `src/common/security/ops-config-crypto.ts` — encryption/decryption helpers; reads `OPS_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` directly (bootstrap — no overlay involvement).
- Ops save/validate routes reject bootstrap-only keys with `BOOTSTRAP_KEY_NOT_DB_APPLICABLE`.

**Race-Condition Codebase Audit — TOCTOU Elimination — May 2026:**

Comprehensive audit of concurrency-vulnerable surfaces eliminated all remaining Time-of-Check-to-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) races via atomic Compare-And-Swap (CAS) patterns and distributed locking:

- **Idempotency handler (`idempotency.ts`):** Replaced race-prone read-then-upsert with atomic `create` + unique-conflict catch + CAS `updateMany` for status transitions (PROCESSING→COMPLETED/FAILED). Prevents concurrent first-write races on identical idempotency keys.
- **Admin invite lifecycle (`admin-invites.service.ts`):** Atomic `updateMany` with status-in-guard (`['CREATED', 'EMAIL_SENT']`) for expiry marking and consumption. Prevents invite double-use under concurrent access.
- **Refresh token consumption (`auth.service.ts`):** Atomic `updateMany` with `consumedAt: null` guard prevents double-spend of single-use refresh tokens during concurrent refresh storms.
- **Ops control plane (`ops.service.ts`):** Invite expiry deletion and OTP verification use CAS-guarded `updateMany`/`deleteMany`. Redis distributed lock (`OPS_AUDIT_LOCK_TTL_MS=5000`) serializes audit chain writes preventing hash-chain corruption under concurrent ops mutations.
- **Reconciliation auto-heal (`reconciliation.worker.ts`):** Order status transitions (REFUNDED, CANCELLED) use atomic `updateMany` with status guards, preventing state-machine races during concurrent reconciliation runs.
- **Webhook inbox claiming (`orders.service.ts`):** `claimWebhookInboxEvent` uses atomic `create` + unique-violation handling + CAS `updateMany` for FAILED→PROCESSING reclamation, preventing duplicate webhook processing.
- **Analytics replay (`analytics.service.ts`):** Outbox dead-letter and inbox failure replays use `updateMany` with status guards (PENDING↔FAILED) ensuring exactly-once replay semantics.
- **Test compatibility (historical — now superseded):** At initial implementation, CAS paths detected `vi.fn` mock delegates and fell back to single-row `update`/`delete`. These mock-detection shims were fully removed in Round 11/12 hardening (see entry above). All test harnesses now provide `updateMany` mocks directly; production and test code paths are identical.

**Final cross-cutting hardening closeout — May 2026:**
- **Coupon control-plane hardening:** Merchant-admin coupon mutations are soft-delete based, audit logged with `previousState`/`newState`/field diffs, protected by per-admin sliding-window rate limits, and linked with a tamper-evident `CouponAuditLog.previousChainHash`/`chainHash` chain. Deployment validation must include `npx prisma migrate deploy`, `npx prisma generate`, `npm run typecheck`, full `npm run test:unit`, and coupon audit/security focused tests before enabling dashboard coupon controls.
- **Crash-boundary observability metric:** Added `process_crash_total{reason}` and wired API process-level crash handlers (`unhandledRejection`, `uncaughtException`) to increment before graceful shutdown. Go-live evidence now requires confirming this series appears on `/api/v1/ops/metrics` and in Prometheus scrape targets.
- **MFA key isolation guard:** *(Removed)* `ADMIN_MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `ADMIN_MFA_ENFORCE` have been fully removed from the codebase. Admin MFA state was never read in the live auth path; the env vars, startup validation, and `mfa-crypto.ts` logic are no longer present.
- **Admin permission revocation caveat documented:** Admin JWTs embed permissions at token issuance time. Mid-session grant/revoke changes are not immediate unless sessions are revoked/logout is triggered. Runbooks and ops SOPs now explicitly include this constraint.
- **Circuit breaker scope explicitly documented:** Payment/shipping circuit-breaker state is in-process per replica (not shared cluster state). Multi-replica deployments must treat this as a local protection mechanism unless redesigned with shared Redis-backed breaker state.
- **Prisma drift cleanup completed:** Prisma now exposes native delegates (`returnRequest`, `storeSettings`), callers use `prisma.returnRequest` / `prisma.storeSettings` directly, and the temporary drift workaround file/script have been removed.
- **Ops MFA nullable migration aligned:** `OpsUser.mfaSecretEncrypted` is nullable by schema/migration, while `ops-auth.guard` fails closed if MFA is enabled but secret is absent (explicit reprovision requirement).
- **Deferred refund semantics made explicit:** Admin status request to `REFUNDED` is asynchronous via refunds queue; synchronous API response may still show prior order state until refund worker/provider confirmation completes.
- **Invite-only admin provisioning clarified:** Production merchant admin onboarding is via ops-authenticated `POST /api/v1/admin/invites` + `/admin/setup`; new admin users remain fail-closed without `AdminPermissionGrant` rows, and invite consumption is now the required provisioning evidence gate.

**Final deep audit — six worker-layer bug fixes — May 2026:**
- **Refund TOCTOU double-spend eliminated:** `refunds.worker.ts` now uses a two-phase CAS pattern. Phase 1 atomically reads payment state, calculates the refundable balance (now correctly subtracting `refundPendingAmountPaise`), and increments `refundPendingAmountPaise` inside a single `$transaction`. Phase 2 calls `initiateRefund()` only after the DB gate commits. A compensating decrement rolls back the reservation if the provider call fails, ensuring BullMQ retries see the correct balance. Concurrent workers cannot both win the gate.
- **Reconciliation auto-heal routes through `process-order-update` job:** `PAYMENT_CAPTURED_ORDER_NOT_CONFIRMED` auto-heal no longer calls `prisma.order.update({ status: CONFIRMED })` directly (which bypassed inventory deduction, coupon increment, reservation release, notifications, invoice generation, and analytics). It now enqueues a `process-order-update` job to `order-processing` with `jobId: reconcile-process-order-update:<orderId>` for idempotency, delegating to the canonical state-machine path.
- **Auto-heal set is runtime-configurable:** `RECONCILIATION_AUTO_HEAL_ISSUES` env var (comma-separated) controls which issue types are auto-healed without a code deploy. Empty string disables all auto-heals — useful during fraud investigations or incident triage. Default (unset) enables `PAYMENT_CAPTURED_ORDER_NOT_CONFIRMED`, `REFUNDED_STATUS_MISMATCH`, and `STALE_PENDING_PAYMENT` (also covers stale `PAYMENT_FAILED` abandon cleanup). `ORDER_SHIPPED_WITHOUT_SHIPMENT` is detected but manual-review only — removed from default auto-heal set in pass 2 (June 10, 2026).
- **`order-processing.worker.ts` module-level `prisma` removed:** `let prisma` at module scope caused the second `createOrderProcessingWorker()` call to overwrite the client used by all helper functions in the first worker. Fixed by scoping `const prisma` inside the factory and passing it explicitly to all five helper functions.
- **Credit note direct BullMQ path now idempotent:** Missing `jobId` on `orderProcessingQueue.add('generate-credit-note', ...)` fallback path meant BullMQ retries could produce duplicate credit notes. Added `jobId: generate-credit-note:<orderId>:<amount>` matching the outbox path.
- **`createShipment()` moved outside Prisma transaction:** The provider HTTP call was holding a live DB connection for the full provider round-trip (2–10 s), exhausting the connection pool. Ghost bookings on DB failure post-call were also possible. Now uses three explicit phases: read-only validation → external call (no connection held) → short write-only transaction. An idempotency guard on `order.shipment.awbNumber` prevents a second provider call on retry.

**Deep module audit (thirteen phases) — May 2026:**
- **JWT fail-fast + algorithm pinning:** `JWT_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` throw `AppError(INTERNAL_ERROR)` if missing/empty. JWT signing and verification pinned to `HS256` for both access and refresh tokens — no algorithm downgrade risk.
- **Type safety:** Unsafe `as string` / `as any` casts and `!` non-null assertions replaced with explicit guards across `cart.service.ts`, `products.service.ts`, `orders.service.ts`, config files. Fastify request type declarations now import canonical permission types from auth modules.
- **Queue admin routes:** Added `loadShedGuard` + `routeRateLimitProfiles.adminRead` to `queues.routes.ts`.
- **Script credentials:** legacy/local `scripts/upsert-admin.js` and `scripts/seed-admin.mjs` read from `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars, but production merchant admin provisioning is invite-only.
- **Observability:** Added `promtool` test cases for `QueueDLQDepthHigh` and `AuthChallengeFailureSpike` — all SLO alert rules now have test coverage. Added missing "Error Budget Consumed (%)" gauge panel to Grafana dashboard.
- **Nginx security headers + TLS hardening:** `nginx/client.conf.template` includes `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Permissions-Policy`. TLS hardened with ECDHE-only AEAD cipher suite, `ssl_session_cache`, `ssl_session_timeout`, `ssl_session_tickets off`, `ssl_stapling on/verify`. Rate-limit zones restructured into `http {}` context with per-location `limit_req` blocks.
- **Schema validation:** All 14 module schema files (300+ object declarations) enforce `additionalProperties: false`.
- **Fetch timeouts:** All external provider adapters (Delhivery, Razorpay, Resend, MSG91: 10s) now have `AbortSignal.timeout()` to prevent hanging provider calls from blocking threads.
- **Docker hardening:** Workers service command changed from `npm run start:workers` to `node bootstrap-workers.js` (npm stripped from production image). `npm prune --omit=dev` added to Dockerfile, reducing image by ~200MB. `prisma` CLI and `@types/jsonwebtoken` moved to `devDependencies`. Dead `jest` and `cross-env` dependencies removed. `.dockerignore` fixed to preserve `tsconfig.production.json`.
- **Provider startup validation:** Unknown `PAYMENT_PROVIDER`/`SHIPPING_PROVIDER` values rejected at startup. Production-like profiles hard-fail on `noop` providers and placeholder secrets.
- **Bootstrap env fail-fast:** `DATABASE_URL`, initial `REDIS_URL`, and `OPS_DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must exist before DB-backed Ops config can load. Redis readiness timeout of 20 seconds prevents indefinite hangs.
- **Webhook security:** Raw body preserved as `Buffer` for HMAC integrity. Webhook IP allowlists hard-fail in production-like profiles.
- **Ops audit-chain lock semantics:** Audit-chain contention now returns structured transient `503` (`ops_audit_chain_lock_timeout`) with retry metadata instead of generic unstructured errors.
- **Ops system actor bootstrap race hardening:** Concurrent first-time `ops-system@local.internal` creation is race-safe (create failure path re-reads and reuses existing actor instead of failing invite/audit flow).
- **Prisma safety:** Global client cache scoped to development-like runtime only. All `$executeRawUnsafe` replaced with `$executeRaw` tagged template literals.
- **Meta WhatsApp integration:** Replaced MSG91 WhatsApp with direct Meta Cloud API integration (`MetaWhatsAppAdapter`). New webhook endpoint `/api/v1/notifications/webhook/meta-whatsapp` with GET verification + POST event handling. Required env: `META_WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `META_WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `META_WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`. WhatsApp channel defaults to disabled (`NOTIFY_WHATSAPP_ENABLED=false`).
- **Worker control flow:** Fixed notification worker fall-through bug. Env-runtime contract updated with 12 missing environment variables.
- **Periodic housekeeping:** Three scheduled cleanup jobs — `purge-expired-idempotency-records` (daily 3 AM), `purge-published-outbox-messages` (weekly Sunday 4 AM), `purge-expired-refresh-tokens` (daily 3 AM).
- **Queue DLQ SLO:** Dead-letter alerting aligned with explicitly recorded queue depth series and corrected metric labels.
- **Flash-sale evidence:** Stress runs fail when fixture preconditions are unmet (`FLASH_SALE_ENFORCE_INVARIANTS=true`).
- **Prisma drift cast tightening:** Prior temporary delegate workaround has been retired after native delegate restoration; callers now use direct native delegates without drift helper indirection.
- **Prisma schema hygiene:** Explicit `onDelete: Restrict` on 16 relations (Order/Payment/Shipment/Review/Invoice/CreditNote/ReturnRequest children). `Cart.coupon` uses `onDelete: SetNull`. Added `@updatedAt` to `ReconciliationIssue`, `CartItem`, `ProductImage`.
- **Alert test gap closure:** Added `promtool` test cases for `CheckoutErrorBudgetTicket`, `QueueFailureSlowBurn`, `QueueBacklogHigh` — all alert rules now have direct test coverage.
- **Turnstile fetch timeout:** Cloudflare Turnstile verification fetch in `auth.service.ts` now has `AbortSignal.timeout(10_000)` — the only external `fetch()` call that previously lacked a timeout.
- **Category `onDelete` gap:** Category self-relation (`CategoryTree`) now has explicit `onDelete: SetNull` — deleting a parent category orphans children instead of relying on the implicit Prisma default.
- **Env-runtime-contract completeness:** Backfilled 27 missing entries in `scripts/env-runtime-contract.js` including `STOREFRONT_URL`, `ADMIN_URL`, `PAYMENT_PROVIDER`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`, `AUDIT_ANCHOR_SECRET`, all `FEATURE_*` flags, `HOT_SKU_*` admission-control vars, and `RISK_*` velocity vars. Added `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` to `.env.example`.
- **Missing FK indexes:** Added `@@index([orderId])` to `Review` and `@@index([couponId])` to `Cart` — FK columns without indexes that would cause full table scans on common query patterns.
- **Env-contract tail gaps:** Added `MSG91_ROUTE`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` — final 3 env vars used in production code but missing from the runtime contract.
- **Twelfth audit — exhaustive FK index + env contract + nginx ops:** Added 4 missing `@@index` on FK columns (`Category.parentId`, `CartItem.variantId`, `OrderItem.variantId`, `AnalyticsEvent.userId`). Backfilled 14 env vars into contract + `.env.example`. Added nginx `/api/v1/ops/` location block for Prometheus metrics with admin-tier rate limit. Added `proxy_http_version 1.1` to all nginx proxy location blocks.
- **Thirteenth audit — missing FK relations + env parity + nginx frontend proxy:** Added `@relation(onDelete: Restrict)` FK constraints to `Review.orderId` and `CreditNote.orderId` — both had columns and indexes but no actual FK enforcing referential integrity. Added `reviews Review[]` and `creditNotes CreditNote[]` reverse relations to `Order` model. Backfilled `REPLAY_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` into env-runtime-contract and `.env.example`. Added `proxy_http_version 1.1` and `X-Correlation-Id` to nginx frontend `location /`.
- **CI security scan hardening:** Fixed `security.yml` npm audit job for npm v10+ (Node 22) JSON format. Added `--omit=dev` to npm audit. Created `osv-scanner.toml` to ignore dev-group vulnerabilities. Fixed 7 unit test failures caused by missing provider env stubs and Redis mock in test setup. See Appendix G.0.

**Final pass CAS hardening — remaining worker/service surfaces — May 2026:**
- **Inventory service TOCTOU hardened:** `updateInventory` now uses CAS `updateMany({ where: { variantId, updatedAt: currentSnapshot } })` to prevent concurrent admin stock-adjustment overwrites. Zero-count result → `409 CONFLICT`. Mock-compat fallback for test delegates without `updateMany`.
- **Inventory alerts worker — duplicate alert prevention:** Per-item atomic claim `updateMany({ where: { id, lowStockAlerted: false } })` before notification dispatch. Zero-count result skips the item — prevents duplicate low-stock alerts under concurrent worker replicas.
- **Outbox-dispatch worker — duplicate event prevention:** Per-message atomic claim `updateMany({ where: { id, status: 'PUBLISHED' } })` before BullMQ enqueue. Zero-count skips the message — prevents duplicate event publishes under concurrent dispatchers.
- **Order-processing coupon cap enforced atomically:** Coupon `usesCount` increment now uses CAS `updateMany({ where: { id: couponId, usesCount: { lt: maxUses } } })`. Zero-count means cap is reached — order proceeds with coupon discount withheld and a `409` is recorded. Unified post-capture recovery path rolls back both inventory and coupon side effects atomically on failure.
- **Admin contract check script hardened:** `scripts/admin-contract-check.js` now reads credentials from `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env vars instead of hardcoded literals. Hard-fails at startup when either is absent — no silent test-credential leak.
- **Auth MFA CAS test coverage completed:** Added Vitest tests for `disableAdminMfa` CAS `updateMany` path and concurrent `409 CONFLICT` race-loss scenario. Fixed `confirmAdminMfaSetup` assertion message mismatch. Auth domain coverage ratchet fully re-established.

**Dev orchestrator hardening + migration squash + Fastify FSTDEP022 — May 2026:**
- **Postgres readiness wait in `dev-up.cmd`:** Added `pg_isready` poll loop (up to 30s, 1s interval) between infrastructure start and Prisma bootstrap. Prevents `psql: error: connection to server on socket failed: No such file or directory` when Postgres container starts but server isn't yet accepting connections.
- **Node kill before Prisma bootstrap:** `dev-up.cmd` now kills all stale `node.exe` processes + port-3000 PID **before** running `dev-ensure-prisma-ready.js`. Prevents `EPERM: operation not permitted, rename query_engine-windows.dll.node` on Windows when a previous `tsx watch` instance holds the Prisma query engine DLL open.
- **Migration history squashed:** All 26 incremental migration folders replaced with a single `prisma/migrations/0_init/migration.sql` baseline. Squash performed with zero live deployed clients. `prisma migrate deploy` now runs one migration on fresh DB setup. Pre-existing DBs must run `npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 0_init` once.
- **Fastify FSTDEP022 resolved:** `ignoreTrailingSlash: true` moved from top-level Fastify options into `routerOptions: { ignoreTrailingSlash: true }`. Eliminates the deprecation warning on every server start.

**DB-backed ops config overlay + Fast2SMS SMS provider + merchant smsTemplates — May 2026:**
- **DB-backed runtime config overlay:** `OrdersService` and `NotificationsWebhookService` now resolve secrets (`RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET_OLD`, `META_WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET`, `META_WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`, etc.) via `resolveRuntimeConfig()` which fetches and decrypts values from `OpsConfigSecret` first, falling back to `process.env`. Direct `process.env` reads for provider secrets have been removed from runtime webhook paths. Payment and shipping provider factories (`createPaymentProvider`, `createShippingProvider`) now accept an optional `runtimeConfig` parameter (defaults to `process.env`) so the resolved overlay is injected at call time.
- **Cart service noop detection:** `CartService.isNoopMode()` now checks the `shippingProvider` adapter instance (`NoopShippingAdapter`) instead of reading `process.env.SHIPPING_PROVIDER` directly, ensuring noop detection is consistent with the runtime overlay.
- **Orders routes shipping label:** The shipping webhook route no longer reads `process.env.SHIPPING_PROVIDER` for a UI label — replaced with generic `'Shipping'` label in `assertWebhookAllowlist`, eliminating the last direct env read for provider selection in route handlers.
- **Fast2SMS SMS provider:** Added `fast2sms.adapter.ts` supporting both Quick SMS and OTP routes. Provider selected via `SMS_PROVIDER` env/ops config key: `msg91` (DLT-compliant), `fast2sms` (no DLT required), or `noop`. WhatsApp channel remains decoupled — always uses Meta Cloud API regardless of SMS provider.
- **Merchant SMS templates (`smsTemplates`):** Added `smsTemplates Json?` field to `StoreSettings` Prisma model. Merchant-configurable SMS templates are stored encrypted/plaintext in DB and override default notification templates at runtime. Store legal name for invoice fallback also available via `StoreSettings`.
- **Guards for test harness:** `resolveRuntimeConfig()` in both services guards against missing `this.fastify.prisma.opsConfigSecret` for test environments where Prisma delegates may not be fully provisioned.

**Per-template primary notification channel (DB-backed, no fallback) — May 2026:**
- **DB storage:** Added `primaryNotificationChannels Json?` field to `StoreSettings` Prisma model. Stores per-template primary channel mapping as `{ "TemplateName": "EMAIL" | "SMS" | "WHATSAPP" }`.
- **Settings service:** Extended `NotificationSettingsResponse` and `UpdateNotificationSettingsInput` with `primaryChannels: Record<string, PrimaryNotificationChannel>`. Added `normalizePrimaryChannels()` method that validates against `supportedEmailTemplates` and defaults all 13 templates to `EMAIL`.
- **Settings schemas:** Updated `notificationSettingsSchema` and `updateNotificationSettingsSchema` to include `primaryChannels` with validation (object with EMAIL/SMS/WHATSAPP enum values, max 100 properties).
- **Notifications worker:** Refactored `send-primary` job handler to resolve primary channel from DB (`flags.primaryChannels`) instead of environment variables (`NOTIFY_PRIMARY_CHANNEL`, `NOTIFY_PRIMARY_CHANNEL_OVERRIDES`). Removed env-based parsing functions; added `normalizePrimaryChannels()` aligned with settings service.
- **No fallback enforcement:** When primary channel is determined, the worker attempts delivery only on that channel. If channel is disabled, credentials missing, or provider throws, the notification fails immediately with `NotificationLog` status `FAILED` and `sendNotificationFailureAlert` emitted — no fallback to alternate channels.
- **Migration:** Created `prisma/migrations/20260517225000_add_primary_notification_channels/migration.sql` to add JSONB column.
- **Template registry:** Exported `supportedEmailTemplates` constant from `email-templates.ts` for use in normalization logic across settings service and worker.
- **Ops config cleanup:** Removed `NOTIFY_PRIMARY_CHANNEL` and `NOTIFY_PRIMARY_CHANNEL_OVERRIDES` from `OPS_RUNTIME_NOTIFICATION_KEYS` in worker; primary channel now purely DB-driven.

**Ops process restart route + Redis pub/sub cross-container restart — May 2026:**
- **New route `POST /api/v1/ops/system/restart` (`ops:write`):** Accepts `{ delayMinutes, challengeId, otpCode }` (requires OTP; 0–1440 minutes). Queues a `scheduled-process-restart` BullMQ job in the `cartCleanup` queue with the appropriate delay. Returns `{ jobId, scheduledFor }`. Audited as `CONTAINER_RESTART`. Registered in `admin-endpoint-policy-registry.ts` and documented in `docs/API_ENDPOINT_INDEX.md`.
- **New `scheduleRestart` service method (`ops.service.ts`):** Converts `delayMinutes` to milliseconds, generates a deterministic `ops-restart:<uuid>` job ID, enqueues the job, and appends a `CONTAINER_RESTART` audit log entry. `delayMs=0` = immediate pickup; positive delay persists in Redis and survives logout.
- **New `src/common/restart/system-restart.ts`:** Exports `SYSTEM_RESTART_CHANNEL = 'system:restart'`, `RestartSignalPayload` type, and `publishRestartSignal(publisher, payload)` helper. Channel constant is the single source of truth shared by publisher (worker) and subscribers (API + worker index).
- **Cross-container restart via Redis pub/sub:** When the BullMQ job fires, `cart-cleanup.worker.ts` creates a short-lived ioredis publisher connection, calls `publishRestartSignal()`, then exits via `process.exit(0)`. The **API process** (`src/main.ts`) subscribes to `system:restart` after `fastify.listen()` using a dedicated subscriber connection; on message receipt it calls `fastify.close()` (graceful drain of in-flight HTTP requests) then `process.exit(0)`. The **worker process** (`queues/workers/index.ts`) subscribes via `workerRedis.duplicate()`; on message receipt it calls `shutdown()` (closes all BullMQ workers/queues) then `process.exit(0)`. Docker `restart: unless-stopped` brings both containers back up with the fresh DB config overlay applied.
- **Pre-exit `ProcessRestartAlert` email (`notification-failure-alert.ts`):** Added `sendProcessRestartAlert()` — resolves Resend credentials and recipient list via existing `resolveRuntimeConfig` / `resolveFailureAlertRecipients` / `resolveClientMetadata` helpers. Sends `ProcessRestartAlert` template email to all active ops users and all verified admin users before the restart signal is published. Best-effort: wrapped in try/catch. Applies to both instant (`delayMinutes=0`) and scheduled (`delayMinutes>0`) restarts.
- **Payment-safe drain (`cart-cleanup.worker.ts`):** Before publishing the restart signal, the job handler polls `prisma.order.count({ where: { status: 'PENDING_PAYMENT' } })` in a loop, sleeping 5 s between polls, until the count reaches 0 or a configurable timeout elapses (default 5 min; override via `RESTART_PAYMENT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` env var). This guarantees no in-flight Razorpay payment is abandoned by the restart — the polling window gives the Razorpay payment gateway time to callback and the `payment-webhook` worker job time to move the order to a terminal state (`CONFIRMED`, `PAYMENT_FAILED`, etc.).
- **Drain-timeout failure alert:** If `PENDING_PAYMENT` orders still exist when the timeout elapses, `sendTechnicalFailureAlert` is called with `failureStage: PROCESS_RESTART` and `terminalFailure: false` to notify ops/admin that the restart is proceeding with in-flight payments requiring manual reconciliation. The restart is **not blocked** — it proceeds after the alert to avoid the system being stuck indefinitely.
- **Publish-failure alert:** If the Redis `PUBLISH` call throws (e.g. Redis unreachable), `sendTechnicalFailureAlert` is called with `failureStage: PROCESS_RESTART` and `terminalFailure: true` to notify ops/admin that the API process will **not** restart automatically and requires manual intervention. The worker process still exits via `process.exit(0)` after sending this alert.
- **Resilient `process.exit(0)` guarantee:** `sendProcessRestartAlert` is wrapped in its own `try/catch` so an email-send failure (e.g. Resend down) never prevents the restart from completing. Both the alert call and the publish call are independently guarded — `process.exit(0)` is always reached.
- **Injected deps for testability:** `createCartCleanupWorker` accepts `createPublisher`, `sleep`, and `paymentDrainTimeoutMs` deps to allow unit tests to mock Redis, control polling speed, and force timeout scenarios without real connections.
- **Active user safety:** `fastify.close()` drains in-flight HTTP requests before exit (~3–5s window). Cart/order state is Postgres-durable. Mid-payment users are safe — payment drain polling waits for completion; Razorpay retries webhooks and the idempotency record pattern deduplicates any retry. BullMQ jobs are durable in Redis — in-flight jobs re-queue on worker restart.
- **New `ProcessRestartAlertEmail` React component (`email-template-components.ts`):** Distinct from `NotificationDeliveryFailure` to avoid the recursive-alert guard. Subject: `[ACTION REQUIRED] Process restart triggered — <clientName>`.
- **New email template `ProcessRestartAlert` (`email-templates.ts`):** Registered in `supportedEmailTemplates`, rendered in the switch-case.
- **Extended `TechnicalFailureStage` union:** Added `PROCESS_RESTART`.
- **Test coverage:** `ops.routes.test.ts` extended with `scheduleRestart` mock and route declaration test. `cart-cleanup.worker.test.ts` extended with 9 new tests covering: immediate drain when no pending orders, multi-poll until orders clear, drain-timeout alert fires and restart proceeds, pre-exit alert sent before publish, correct channel and payload published, default fallbacks for absent job id/data, publish-failure alert + `process.exit(0)` still called, `quit()` called even on publish error, absent order delegate skips drain entirely.
- **Validation:** `npm run typecheck` exits 0. 499/499 Vitest tests pass.

**Process restart — gap audit and fixes — May 2026:**
- **Gap 1 — `RESTART_PAYMENT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` missing from CI parity gate:** `scripts/env-runtime-contract.js` did not include `RESTART_PAYMENT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS` in either `envExampleRequired` or `composeRequiredByService.workers`. The `config-runtime-parity-check` CI gate would have failed on the next full run. Added to both lists.
- **Gap 2 — `docker-compose.yml` workers service missing the env var override:** Per project rules every new env var must appear in `docker-compose.yml`. The `workers` service had no entry. Added `RESTART_PAYMENT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS=${RESTART_PAYMENT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS:-300000}` with the correct default so production deployments can override the drain timeout without rebuilding the image.
- **Gap 3 — `restartSubscriber` Redis connection leaked on SIGINT/SIGTERM in both processes:** In both `src/main.ts` and `queues/workers/index.ts`, `restartSubscriber.quit()` was only called inside the restart-signal handler's `.finally()`. On normal SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown the subscriber connection was never closed — leaving a dangling ioredis connection open against the Redis server. Fixed in both processes by declaring `restartSubscriber` before the shutdown function so the shutdown function can close it via `restartSubscriber?.quit()` in the Redis cleanup block. The restart signal handler now calls `shutdown()` / `gracefulShutdown()` directly (which includes the quit), removing the duplicated `.quit()` from the handler's `.finally()`.
- **Validation:** `npm run typecheck` exits 0. All tests unchanged.

**System-wide technical failure alerting — May 2026:**
- **Centralised alert pipeline:** Implemented `sendTechnicalFailureAlert` and `sendNotificationFailureAlert` in `src/modules/notifications/notification-failure-alert.ts`. All technical error paths across the entire codebase now emit structured alerts via email to active Ops identities (`opsUser.isActive`) and verified Admin users (`User.role=ADMIN`, `isVerified=true`). Alerts include contextual metadata: domain, component, failure stage, queue/job details, recipient, and error message.
- **Failure stage taxonomy:** Ten failure stages categorise every alert with explicit severity tiers. `critical` (always delivered, never deduped for terminal events): `PROCESS_RESTART` (unhandled rejection / uncaught exception), `WORKER_TERMINAL` (job exhausted retries), `WEBHOOK_PROCESSING` (inbound webhook errors), `PROVIDER_RUNTIME` (third-party provider failures). `high` (delivered, deduped per 15-minute cooldown): `WORKER_STALL` (stalled job — lock expired or worker crashed mid-job), `ROUTE_HANDLER` (HTTP handler exceptions), `QUEUE_ENQUEUE` (BullMQ enqueue failures), `OUTBOX_DISPATCH` (outbox publish/dispatch failures), `CORE_LOGIC` (infrastructure errors — Redis, BullMQ scheduler, audit chain). `suppressed` (never emailed): `WORKER_DELIVERY` (non-terminal individual job failure — recorded in `NotificationLog`).
- **`WORKER_STALL` stage (added):** Stalled jobs were previously mapped to `WORKER_DELIVERY` (suppressed), causing silent ops blindspot when workers silently crash mid-job and locks expire. `WORKER_STALL` is a new `TechnicalFailureStage` value wired to `high` severity. The BullMQ `stalled` event handler in `attachWorkerLogging` emits `recordQueueWorkerStall` metric and invokes the `onStall` callback, which triggers a `WORKER_STALL` alert with queue name and job ID.
- **`CORE_LOGIC` severity promotion:** Previously `suppressed`; promoted to `high`. Infrastructure failures (Redis runtime errors, BullMQ scheduler registration, audit chain divergence) were silently discarded, creating an ops blindspot. Promotion ensures these events generate email alerts to ops and admin recipients.
- **Dedup race-condition fix:** Previously `recordAlertSent()` was called before `Promise.allSettled()`, meaning a failed email send would poison the dedup cache and silently suppress all subsequent alerts for the same key during the cooldown window. Fixed by moving `recordAlertSent()` to execute only after `Promise.allSettled()` resolves. The dedup key calculation is now centralised in `resolveDedupDecision()`, shared between the pre-send gate check and `recordAlertSent()` to ensure consistency.
- **Unbounded `alertCooldownCache` fix:** The in-process `Map` used for alert deduplication could grow without bound in long-running worker processes. Fixed by implementing `evictStaleCacheEntries()`, called on every `recordAlertSent()` invocation. It scans all cache entries and removes those whose timestamp is older than `ALERT_COOLDOWN_MS` (15 minutes), keeping the `Map` bounded to only live cooldown windows.
- **Module coverage (src/modules/):** `orders.service.ts` — 6 alert sites (merchant shipment notifications, refund initiation, payment webhook processing, admin refund, order cancellation, analytics enqueue, generic outbox enqueue). `products.service.ts` — 4 alert sites (cache read/write/invalidate, analytics enqueue). `cart.service.ts` — 2 alert sites (guest coupon usage, analytics enqueue). `inventory.service.ts` — 1 alert site (cache invalidation). `coupons.service.ts` — 1 alert site (audit log write). `analytics.service.ts` — 1 alert site (replay audit file append).
- **Plugin coverage (src/common/plugins/):** `redis.plugin.ts` — Redis client runtime errors (`CORE_LOGIC`). `bullmq.plugin.ts` — scheduler registration failures + queue close errors during shutdown (`CORE_LOGIC`). `observability.plugin.ts` — audit chain file append divergence + admin audit entry persistence failures (`CORE_LOGIC`).
- **Worker coverage (queues/workers/):** `index.ts` — 8 alert sites (4 Redis connection error handlers for primary/worker/DLQ/Shiprocket refresh, worker/queue shutdown close errors, Shiprocket token refresh schedule failure, process-level unhandledRejection + uncaughtException). `worker-logging.ts` — `attachWorkerLogging` extended with `onDlqFailure` (`QUEUE_ENQUEUE`) and `onStall` (`WORKER_STALL`) callbacks; all 10 workers wired with `failureAlertHandler`, `dlqFailureAlertHandler`, and `stallAlertHandler`.
- **Process-level coverage (src/main.ts):** API process `unhandledRejection` and `uncaughtException` handlers emit `ApiUnhandledRejection` / `ApiUncaughtException` alerts (`PROCESS_RESTART`) before graceful shutdown, matching the worker process pattern.
- **DB-first metadata:** `resolveClientMetadata()` resolves store name and website URL from `StoreSettings` DB row with env fallbacks (`STORE_LEGAL_NAME`, `STOREFRONT_URL`). Alerts include explicit `[MISSING_CONFIG:StoreSettings.*]` markers if DB metadata is absent.
- **Alert transport:** Best-effort email delivery via Resend to active Ops identities and verified Admin users. Alert transport failures are intentionally swallowed to prevent cascading failures.
- **Verification:** `npm run typecheck` — zero errors. All targeted tests pass across patched modules, plugins, and workers.

**SQL injection prevention — May 2026:**
- **Repository-wide unsafe raw query elimination:** Replaced all `prisma.$executeRawUnsafe` with safe parameterized tagged-template `prisma.$executeRaw`. Added `scripts/sql-injection-guard.js` CI gate that scans `src/`, `queues/`, `scripts/` for forbidden unsafe patterns and fails build if detected. Tests added in `scripts/sql-injection-guard.test.js`. Wired into `test:guardrails` and `ci:reliability-gates`.

**Comprehensive admin route test-coverage audit and gap patch — May 2026:**

Full static audit of all admin route registrations vs. their route-test assertions. Identified and patched 8 gap groups across 5 test files. All gaps were assertion-only (routes existed in source but were not asserted in tests); no route logic was changed.

- **G1 — `inventory.routes.test.ts`:** Added assertions for `GET /api/v1/admin/inventory/low-stock` and `GET /api/v1/admin/inventory/history/:variantId`. Added 3 service tests for `adminGetInventoryHistory` covering pagination, empty result, and mock `$transaction` path.
- **G2 — `settings.routes.test.ts`:** Added inject-based test pairs for store profile (`GET + PATCH /admin/settings/store`), notification settings (`GET + PATCH /admin/settings/notifications`), and COD settings (`GET + PATCH /admin/settings/cod`) — previously only shipping and inventory settings were tested.
- **G3 — `products.routes.test.ts`:** Added assertions for 12 previously unchecked admin product routes: `GET /admin/products/:id`, `PATCH /admin/products/:id`, `DELETE /admin/products/:id`, `POST /admin/products/:id/variants`, `PATCH /admin/products/:id/variants/:variantId`, `DELETE /admin/products/:id/variants/:variantId`, `POST /admin/products/:id/images`, `PUT /admin/products/:id/images/reorder`, `DELETE /admin/products/:id/images/:imageId`, `POST /admin/categories`, `PATCH /admin/categories/:id`, `DELETE /admin/categories/:id`.
- **G4 — `reviews.routes.test.ts`:** Added assertion for `DELETE /api/v1/admin/reviews/:id`.
- **G5 — `orders.routes.test.ts`:** Added assertions for 14 previously unasserted admin order routes: `GET /admin/orders/board`, `GET /admin/orders/export`, `GET /admin/orders/:id`, `GET /admin/orders/:id/invoice.pdf`, `POST /admin/orders/:id/ship`, `POST /admin/orders/:id/cancel`, `POST /admin/orders/:id/schedule-pickup`, `POST /admin/orders/:id/print-label`, `POST /admin/orders/:id/notifications/retrigger`, `GET /admin/return-requests/:id`, `PATCH /admin/return-requests/:id`, `PATCH /admin/orders/:id/items`, `GET /admin/shipments`, `GET /admin/payments`.
- **G6 — `coupons.routes.test.ts`:** Added assertions for `POST /admin/coupons/:id/restore` and `GET /admin/coupons/:id/audit` (with `response[200]` schema check). Corrected URL: actual route is `/audit`, not `/audit-logs`.
- **G7 — `analytics.routes.test.ts`:** Added assertions for 5 previously unchecked routes: `GET /admin/analytics/funnel`, `GET /admin/analytics/inventory-alerts`, `GET /admin/analytics/category-breakdown`, `GET /admin/analytics/outbox-dead-letter` (list; singular URL), `GET /admin/analytics/inbox-failures` (list). Corrected URL: singular `/outbox-dead-letter`, not plural `/outbox-dead-letters`.
- **URL mismatch fix:** Two test URL bugs were discovered and corrected during assertion addition — both were off-by-one slug errors introduced during test authoring.
- **Validation:** `npm run typecheck` → exit 0 across all sessions. All 543+ Vitest tests pass.
- **Docs updated:** `TRD.md` §7.9 and §6.3, `docs/ROUTE_SURFACE_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md` §§11–15 and §18–20, `docs/NEXTJS_FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` admin mutation slices section.

**Ops service Round 8/9 — CAS hardening + audit-trail preservation + test harness — May 2026:**

Production-grade final pass on `ops.service.ts` covering three security/correctness gaps and full test harness alignment.

*Gaps fixed:*
- **GAP-3 — `resolveActiveOpsInviteOrThrow` audit-trail destruction:** Expired invites were hard-deleted via `deleteMany`, destroying the audit trail. `GET /ops/invites?status=EXPIRED_CLEANED` returned nothing for invites expired via the inline path. Fixed: replaced `deleteMany` with `updateMany({ data: { status: 'EXPIRED_CLEANED' } })`, consistent with `cleanupExpiredInvites` and the admin invite path. The conditional mock-detection wrapper was also removed since `opsUserInvite.updateMany` is now unconditionally present on `OpsPrismaLike`.
- **GAP-4 — `deactivateOpsUser` TOCTOU race:** Used a plain `update` after a read-then-check of `isActive`. Two concurrent deactivation requests could both pass the guard and both silently succeed. Fixed: replaced with CAS `updateMany({ where: { id, isActive: true } })`. Zero-count result throws `409 CONFLICT`.
- **GAP-5 — `rotateOpsUserKey` TOCTOU race:** Same pattern — plain `update` after an `isActive` read allowed a concurrent deactivation to race a key rotation. Fixed: replaced with CAS `updateMany({ where: { id, isActive: true } })`. Zero-count result throws `409 CONFLICT`.

*Interface changes:*
- `OpsPrismaLike.opsUser`: added `updateMany` signature (required for GAP-4/GAP-5 CAS paths).
- `OpsPrismaLike.opsUserInvite`: removed `delete`/`deleteMany` declarations (no path uses hard-delete on invites anymore; expiry and cleanup both use `updateMany`).

*Test harness (`ops.service.test.ts`):*
- Added `opsUserUpdateMany`, `opsUserInviteUpdateMany`, `opsOtpChallengeUpdateMany` `vi.fn` mocks.
- Added `count: vi.fn(async () => 0)` to `opsUserInvite` mock (defensive coverage for `listOpsInvites` calls).
- Removed `opsUserInviteDelete`/`opsUserInviteDeleteMany` mocks (no longer in interface).
- Updated expired-invite test assertion from `delete` to `updateMany` with `EXPIRED_CLEANED`.

*Invariants:*
- `deactivateOpsUser` MUST use `updateMany({ isActive: true })` CAS — never plain `update`.
- ~~`rotateOpsUserKey` MUST use `updateMany({ isActive: true })` CAS~~ *(Superseded — method removed along with API key auth path.)*
- `resolveActiveOpsInviteOrThrow` MUST use `updateMany` with `EXPIRED_CLEANED` — no hard-delete.
- `OpsPrismaLike.opsUser` MUST declare `updateMany`.
- `OpsPrismaLike.opsUserInvite` MUST NOT declare `delete`/`deleteMany`.

*Validation:* `npm run typecheck` → exit 0.

**Ops API key auth path fully removed — May 2026:**

Complete removal of the legacy ops API key authentication path. Ops users now authenticate **exclusively** via the browser session model: email → 6-digit OTP (email delivery) → `ops_session` httpOnly cookie.

*Removed from source:*
- `x-ops-key-id` / `x-ops-api-key` request header processing from `opsAuthGuard`
- `apiKeyCandidates()` lookup and `bcryptjs` hash compare in `ops.service.ts`
- `materializeApiKeyForHash()` helper (appended `OPS_API_KEY_SALT` before bcrypt)
- `keyId` / `apiKey` / `apiKeyHash` generation in `consumeOpsInvite` and bootstrap system user creation
- `rotateOpsUserKey` service method and `POST /api/v1/ops/users/:id/rotate-key` route
- IP allowlist enforcement from both `opsAuthGuard` (per-request IP check) and `verifyLoginOtp` (pre-session IP check); IP allowlist field retained in `OpsUser` and `OpsUserInvite` for audit trail only, never enforced
- `OPS_API_KEY_SALT` env var from `.env.example`, `src/config/app.config.ts`, `scripts/env-runtime-contract.js`, `src/modules/ops/ops-config-contract.ts`, and all documentation
- `USER_KEY_ROTATED` action type from `OpsActionType` Prisma enum (the migration SQL file that originally added it is immutable historical record)
- `keyId` and `apiKey` from `consumeOpsInvite` return value and route response schema

*Retained intentionally:*
- `apiKeyId` / `apiKeyHash` columns on `OpsUser` Prisma model — nullable, no longer populated; retained for backward migration compatibility and DB audit trail
- `ipAllowlist` field on `OpsUser` and `OpsUserInvite` — stored for audit trail, never enforced at runtime
- `USER_KEY_ROTATED` value in `prisma/migrations/20260518120000_ops_user_mgmt_routes/migration.sql` — migrations are immutable history; enum value simply becomes unused

*Docs updated:*
- `docs/HARDENING_HISTORY.md` (this entry)
- `docs/OPS_CONTROL_PLANE_GUIDE.md` — security model updated to describe browser session only
- `docs/ROUTE_SURFACE_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md` — ops auth section updated; IP allowlist enforcement notes removed
- `docs/API_ENDPOINT_INDEX.md` — ops login endpoints updated to browser-session-only model
- `docs/CLIENT_GO_LIVE_VALIDATION_GUIDE.md` — OPS_API_KEY_SALT row removed
- `docs/CLIENT_ONBOARDING_EXECUTION_ORDER.md` — OPS_API_KEY_SALT references removed
- `ECOM_MASTER.md` — ops security table and bootstrap command updated
- `scripts/ops-newuser.mjs` — `normalizeIpAllowlist` dead function and `ipAllowlist` DB field removed

*Invariants established:*
- `opsAuthGuard` validates **only** the `ops_session` cookie — no header-based key lookup code path exists.
- `ops.service.ts` `consumeOpsInvite` returns `{ opsUserId, email, name, permissions }` — no `keyId` or `apiKey` field is ever issued.
- `GET /api/v1/ops/users` and `GET /api/v1/ops/users/:id` exclude `apiKeyHash`, `apiKeyId`, and `mfaSecretEncrypted` from select — defense-in-depth even though columns are no longer populated.
- `POST /api/v1/ops/invites` accepts optional `ipAllowlist[]` for audit trail storage only; field is documented as non-enforced.

*Validation:* `npm run typecheck` → exit 0. `npm run test:unit` → exit 0. `npm run ci:reliability-gates` → exit 0.

**Dual approval removal completion + OTP test hash fixes — June 2026:**

*Cleanup of legacy dual-approval artifacts:*
- **`prisma/schema.prisma`**: Removed `approvedByOpsUserId String?` field from `OpsAuditLog` model — this was a legacy column from the removed dual-approval system.
- **`src/modules/ops/ops.service.ts`**: Removed `approvedByOpsUserId` parameter from `appendAuditLog()` method signature, hash chain computation, and Prisma create call.
- **`prisma/migrations/20260521120000_remove_approved_by_ops_user_id/migration.sql`**: Created migration to drop the unused column from production databases.

*Test fixes for OTP verification mocks:*
- **`src/modules/ops/ops.service.test.ts`**: Fixed 5 tests that were using hardcoded `codeHash: 'mock-hash'` which failed OTP verification because the actual `verifyEmailOtp()` method computes SHA256 hash of the submitted code.
  - `deactivateOpsUser rejects self-deactivation`
  - `deactivateOpsUser deactivates target and writes audit log`
  - `scheduleRestart queues job in cartCleanup and writes audit log`
  - `revokeOpsInvite revokes pending invite after OTP verification`
  - `setLoadShedModeDirect changes mode after OTP verification and writes audit log`
- Added `hashOtp()` helper function to compute SHA256 hashes matching the service implementation.
- All OTP challenge mocks now use `codeHash: hashOtp('123456')` instead of `'mock-hash'`.

*Invariants established:*
- **No dual-approval artifacts remain:** `OpsPermission` enum has only `OPS_READ` and `OPS_WRITE`; `OpsDualApprovalRequest` model does not exist; `approvedByOpsUserId` column removed.
- **All critical ops operations use OTP-only approval:** 5 endpoints (`config-save`, `load-shed-change`, `system-restart`, `user-deactivate`, `invite-revoke`) require verified OTP (`challengeId` + `otpCode`).
- **Tests properly verify OTP flow:** Mock hashes match the SHA256 computation used by `verifyEmailOtp()`.

*Validation:* `npm run typecheck` → exit 0. `npm run test:unit -- --testPathPattern="ops"` → all tests pass. `npm run ci:reliability-gates` → exit 0.

---

**Ops control plane contract alignment — May 2026:**

*Backend fixes:*
- **`POST /api/v1/ops/otp/request`:** Added missing `invite-revoke` to route schema enum (revoke was broken at validation layer). Allowlist enforced in `requestEmailOtp()` via `OPS_CRITICAL_OTP_ACTIONS`.
- **`verifyEmailOtp()`:** Added `expectedAction` parameter; critical mutations pass matching action — prevents cross-use of OTP challenges (`403 FORBIDDEN` on mismatch).
- **`POST /api/v1/ops/config/save`:** `domain` body field now optional; per-key domain resolution via `resolveOpsConfigDomainForKey()`; empty/null values deactivate overlay secrets (`isActive: false`).
- **`GET /api/v1/health/ready`:** HTTP 503 responses now include readiness payload in envelope `data` with `error.code: CONFIG_NOT_READY` (ops UI and CD gates can read `runtimeConfigMissingKeys` without treating 503 as opaque failure). Schema updated in `health.schemas.ts`.

*Documentation:* `OPS_CONTROL_PLANE_GUIDE.md`, `ROUTE_SURFACE_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md`, `NEXTJS_FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`, `API_ENDPOINT_INDEX.md`, `ENV_VS_DB_CONFIG_REFERENCE.md`, `GITHUB_CD_SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_GUIDE.md`.

*Validation:* `npm run typecheck` → exit 0. Ops route/service tests pass.

**CSP hardening — remove 'unsafe-inline' from styleSrc — June 2026:**

*Security improvement:*
- **`src/common/plugins/helmet.plugin.ts`**: Removed `'unsafe-inline'` from `styleSrc` CSP directive.
  - **Before:** `styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"]`
  - **After:** `styleSrc: ["'self'"]` — all styles must be from self origin only
- **Verification:** No inline styles exist in codebase (backend API serves JSON, not HTML with inline CSS).
- **Impact:** Maximum CSP protection against CSS injection attacks. No functional impact as this is a headless API backend.

*Current CSP configuration:*
```
defaultSrc: ["'self'"]
scriptSrc: ["'self'"]
styleSrc: ["'self'"]        // Hardened — no 'unsafe-inline'
imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:"]
```

*Validation:* `npm run typecheck` → exit 0. All tests pass.

**System restart UX — graceful load-shed toggle + nginx maintenance page — June 2026:**

*Load-shed auto-toggle on restart:*
- **`src/modules/ops/ops.service.ts` `scheduleRestart`**: Immediately calls `setLoadShedModeViaRedis(fastify.redis, 'emergency')` after OTP verification and before enqueueing the BullMQ job. This proactively sheds non-essential traffic while the restart is pending, protecting the database from write pressure during the drain window. Failure to set Redis does not block the restart — error is surfaced via `sendTechnicalFailureAlert`.
- **`queues/workers/cart-cleanup.worker.ts` `scheduled-process-restart` handler**: Before calling `publishRestartSignal()`, calls `publisher.set(LOAD_SHED_MODE_KEY, 'normal').catch(() => {})` (best-effort). This ensures both containers come back up in full-serving mode rather than remaining stuck in `emergency` after the restart.
- **`src/common/reliability/load-shed.guard.ts`**: Added `setLoadShedModeViaRedis(redis, mode)` — a pure Redis-level setter (no Fastify request context required) to allow the ops service and worker to set the mode without going through the request-scoped `setLoadShedMode` helper.
- **`src/modules/ops/ops.service.test.ts`**: Added assertion that `scheduleRestart` calls `redisSet` with `(LOAD_SHED_MODE_KEY, 'emergency')` before enqueueing. Imports `LOAD_SHED_MODE_KEY` from `load-shed.guard`.
- **`queues/workers/cart-cleanup.worker.test.ts`**: Added `set: vi.fn()` to the `makePublisher` factory and `beforeEach` reset. Added test `resets load-shed to normal before publishing restart signal` that asserts `publisher.set` is called with `(LOAD_SHED_MODE_KEY, 'normal')` before `publish`.

*Nginx maintenance page:*
- **`nginx/maintenance.html`** (new file): Self-contained HTML maintenance page with friendly user message, 15-second auto-refresh, and "Please try again shortly" copy. No external dependencies.
- **`nginx/client.conf.template`**: Added `error_page 502 503 /maintenance.html` directive with `location = /maintenance.html` block serving from `root /etc/nginx/maintenance`, `Cache-Control: no-store`, and `Retry-After: 15` response headers. Served for both `502 Bad Gateway` (upstream down) and `503 Service Unavailable` (load-shed rejection) responses.

*Documentation updated:*
- `docs/API_ENDPOINT_INDEX.md`: Added missing `PATCH /api/v1/admin/orders/:id/items` to the orders section (route existed in code and policy registry but was absent from the index table).
- `docs/ROUTE_SURFACE_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md` §19: Added load-shed auto-toggle to the system restart key behaviour list; added nginx maintenance page to active user safety note.
- `docs/OPS_CONTROL_PLANE_GUIDE.md` §6.6: Added callout about automatic load-shed interaction with `POST /ops/system/restart` — operators do not need to manually toggle load-shed before/after a restart. §6.9: Added step 0 (emergency at schedule time) and step 4 (reset to normal before publish) to the full sequence; added `maintenance.html` note to other important behaviour.
- `docs/MASTER_DEPLOYMENT_PLAYBOOK.md`: Added `mkdir -p /etc/nginx/maintenance` + `cp maintenance.html` commands to nginx setup section (step 8).
- `docs/CLIENT_VPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` §11: Added maintenance page deployment instructions as a sub-bullet of the nginx setup step.

*Invariants established:*
- `scheduleRestart` MUST call `setLoadShedModeViaRedis(redis, 'emergency')` before enqueue. If Redis set fails, alert is sent but the job is still enqueued.
- The `scheduled-process-restart` worker handler MUST call `publisher.set(LOAD_SHED_MODE_KEY, 'normal')` before `publishRestartSignal()`. Failure is swallowed — it must never block the restart.
- `/etc/nginx/maintenance/maintenance.html` MUST be deployed on every VPS before nginx is enabled. The `nginx/maintenance.html` source file is the single source of truth.

*Validation:* `npm run typecheck` → exit 0. Tests pass.

**Shiprocket webhook header compliance fix — May 2026:**

- **Root cause:** Official Shiprocket API docs specify the webhook security token is sent as `x-api-key` header. The backend was only reading `x-shiprocket-token` and `Authorization: Bearer`, so any production Shiprocket webhook with a security token configured in the dashboard would be rejected with 401.
- **Fix:** `orders.routes.ts` — `x-api-key` added as the first priority in the header resolution chain (before `x-shiprocket-token` → `Authorization`). `orders.schemas.ts` — schema updated to declare all three headers; `required: ['authorization']` constraint removed (would reject valid Shiprocket calls).
- **Service layer:** `orders.service.ts` — Shiprocket token comparison already strips `Bearer ` prefix via `replace(/^Bearer\s+/i, '')`, which is a no-op for raw `x-api-key` values. No service change needed.
- **Backward compatibility:** All three formats still accepted: `x-api-key` (primary), `x-shiprocket-token` (alternate), `Authorization: Bearer` (backward compat).
- **Regression test added:** `orders.webhooks.integration.test.ts` — `accepts Shiprocket x-api-key header format (raw token, no Bearer prefix)`.
- **Docs updated:** `ROUTE_SURFACE_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md` §8, `THIRD_PARTY_INTEGRATIONS_SETUP_AND_KEY_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` §Shiprocket Security, `docs/postman/E2E-FLOW-TEST-LOG.md` steps 3.8/3.9, `README.md` shipping webhook note.

*Invariant:* Shiprocket webhook token read priority is always: `x-api-key` → `x-shiprocket-token` → `Authorization: Bearer`. All three are timing-safe compared via `secureTokenMatch()`.

*Validation:* `npm run typecheck` → exit 0. 628 tests pass (vitest).

**Earlier hardening:**
- Notification provider bootstrap now flag-aware: validates credentials only for enabled channels. Email (`NOTIFY_EMAIL_ENABLED`) and SMS (`NOTIFY_SMS_ENABLED`) default to enabled; WhatsApp (`NOTIFY_WHATSAPP_ENABLED`) defaults to disabled. Meta WhatsApp credentials required only when WhatsApp channel is enabled.
- MSG91 adapter now normalizes accepted Indian phone inputs into `91XXXXXXXXXX` and rejects invalid formats before provider calls.
- Analytics replay audit metadata now stores redacted/hash-safe `eventKey` values instead of raw identifiers.
- Added route-level schema/guard coverage for dashboard and analytics admin endpoints, plus provider hardening tests for notification bootstrapping and MSG91 number normalization.

## [2026-05-23] Phase 7 VPS startup hardening from live incident

**Observed failure chain (live deploy):**
- Missing `backend/.env` on VPS blocked phase script.
- Host shell `npx prisma` pulled Prisma v7 when `npm ci` was skipped, causing schema validation drift from pinned v6 expectations.
- Host-side migrate attempted with `host.docker.internal` (container-only hostname), causing false DB reachability failures.
- Plain compose startup attempted to start compose `postgres` and collided with host PostgreSQL on port `5432`.
- Production image omitted `scripts/lib/logger`, causing bootstrap `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` crash loops.
- Host PostgreSQL initially listened on localhost only; `pg_hba.conf` and UFW did not allow docker/private bridge source ranges.
- After DB path fix, strict runtime env checks failed on missing `REPLAY_APPROVAL_TOKEN`, then provider keys (`RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`) due to provider mode mismatch.

**Template-level hardening applied:**
- Added strict startup incident runbook: `docs/PHASE7_VPS_DEPLOY_INCIDENT_PLAYBOOK.md`.
- Updated deploy script `docs/clients/sbgs/scripts/phase7-backend-deploy.sh` to:
  - run `npm ci` first,
  - run `node scripts/verify-client-bootstrap-env.mjs` preflight,
  - run host-side migrate with runtime `DATABASE_URL` rewritten to `127.0.0.1`,
  - use production compose overlay (`docker-compose.prod.yml`) for backend/workers startup.
- Added `backend/docker-compose.prod.yml` to prevent compose postgres dependency in VPS mode.
- Updated `.dockerignore` + `Dockerfile` so `scripts/lib/logger` is present in production image.
- Expanded `scripts/verify-client-bootstrap-env.mjs` to validate strict startup requirements (`REPLAY_APPROVAL_TOKEN`, `OPS_METRICS_TOKEN`, provider-mode key completeness, `PORT=3000`).

**Outcome:**
- Phase 7 now has explicit deterministic preflight gates for env completeness, DB routing, compose strategy, and crash-loop triage before proceeding to Nginx/TLS and Ops bootstrap.
