# Frontend Core — Changelog

Semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). This file is the **propagation instruction set** for the shared storefront/admin/ops core. Per-client **design** (`app/globals.css` tokens, `lib/fonts.ts`, `lib/constants.ts`, `public/`) is NOT part of core and is never changed by these entries. See `../backend/docs/PLATFORM_VERSIONING_AND_SYNC_GUIDE.md`.

- **PATCH** — bug/a11y/perf fix, no prop/contract change.
- **MINOR** — backward-compatible feature (token-styled so it auto-adopts each client's theme; OFF behind a flag where it adds surface area).
- **MAJOR** — breaking change (component API, route contract, or new required design token).

Each entry MUST carry the **Propagation** block.

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Customer wishlist page (intended: frontend-core 0.1.38, requires backend-core >= 0.1.62).** New `app/(account)/wishlist/page.tsx` renders saved products with the standard `ProductCard` — driven by the enriched `GET /wishlist` (card-ready products). Un-hearting a card removes it instantly (the page filters by the wishlist store's id set). Empty / loading / error / feature-disabled states included. A **Wishlist** entry now appears in the account sidebar (`AccountNav`), the header account dropdown (`MainNav`), and the mobile drawer (`MobileNav`) — all gated on the `wishlistEnabled` store-config flag. `lib/wishlist-api.ts`: list `WishlistItem.product` is now the full `Product`; add-to-wishlist keeps a minimal `WishlistItemSummary`.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (`app/(account)/wishlist/page.tsx`, `components/layout/{AccountNav,MainNav,MobileNav}.tsx`, `lib/wishlist-api.ts`) · Requires backend-core: >= 0.1.62
- Flag: gated by `wishlistEnabled` (StoreSettings) · Design impact: none (uses existing tokens + core `ProductCard`)
- Breaking: NO · Rollback: remove the wishlist page + the three nav entries and revert the `wishlist-api` type

## [0.1.37] — 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Packing weights in the admin (pairs with backend-core 0.1.61).** `BoxPresetsPanel`: each carton preset can now carry an optional **Box weight (g)** — weigh one packed-but-empty carton and enter it; a new **Packaging Weight** section sets the store-level flat override (empty = automatic surface-area estimate). Panel copy explains that couriers weigh the sealed parcel and that this weight is included in every quote/booking. `AdminBoxPresetsSettings`/`BoxPreset` types extended (`boxWeightGrams`, `packagingWeightGrams`).
- **"Packing box" card shows the declared parcel weight split.** Order detail now renders `packagingWeightGrams` ("Incl. packaging: X g") alongside the total sealed-parcel weight, so the merchant sees exactly what was declared to the courier.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (`components/admin/BoxPresetsPanel.tsx`, `components/admin/AdminOrderDetailPanel.tsx`, `lib/admin-api.ts`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none (token-styled) · Breaking: NO — requires backend-core 0.1.61 for the new fields (older backends simply omit them)
- Rollback: revert the three files

## [0.1.36] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- **Deactivated products no longer linger on the storefront during client-side navigation.** Server rendering was already fresh (dynamic pages, no-store fetches, backend cache invalidation on deactivate) — the staleness was Next.js's client-side **Router Cache** replaying visited/prefetched RSC payloads until a hard refresh. `next.config.ts` now sets `experimental.staleTimes = { dynamic: 0, static: 60 }`: every client-side navigation refetches the page from the server, so admin changes (deactivations, price edits, stock) appear on the customer's very next navigation.
- **Auth pages mobile padding** — admin sign-in and reset-password cards used a fixed `p-8`; now `p-5 sm:p-8` + `min-w-0`, matching the customer login/register pages.

### Changed
- **Category image is now upload-only — exactly like product images.** The "Image URL" paste fields are gone from BOTH the category editor page and the quick-create/edit modal (`AdminCategoryForm`). In their place: a file picker (JPEG/PNG/WebP/AVIF), live thumbnail preview, and a Remove button. Edit mode uploads immediately to `POST /admin/categories/:id/image/upload` (replaces + deletes the old CDN object); create mode holds the file and uploads right after the category is created (a failed upload surfaces a toast, never rolls back the category); Remove clears `imageUrl` (PATCH `null`) so the storefront falls back to the neutral placeholder.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (`next.config.ts`, auth pages, `AdminCategoryEditor`, `AdminCategoryForm`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the five files
- Note: `staleTimes.dynamic: 0` trades a little navigation snappiness for storefront correctness — server responses are still fast (backend Redis list cache, 60s TTL, invalidated on writes).

## [0.1.35] — 2026-07-04

### Added
- **"Notify me about new orders" panel** (Admin → Settings → Notifications, above the store-wide routing). Personal per-admin opt-in with EMAIL / WHATSAPP / SMS channel checkboxes, wired to `GET/PATCH /admin/me/notification-preferences`. Saves instantly on toggle; WhatsApp/SMS options are disabled with a hint when the admin account has no phone number; enabling with nothing selected defaults to EMAIL; a failed save reloads server truth so the toggles never lie.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (`components/admin/AdminMyOrderAlertsPanel.tsx`, notifications settings page)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none (per-admin opt-in, OFF by default) · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the two files
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.57 (prefs endpoints + AdminNewOrder fan-out).

## [0.1.34] — 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- **Mobile overflow, closed for good across admin + ops (115 spots in 42 files).** 0.1.32 clamped `AdminSection`, but the same defect lived in every other implicit grid: `grid gap-N` without `grid-cols-1` creates an implicit `auto` track that grows to its content — `min-w-0` on children cannot help because the TRACK itself inflates past the viewport (why the order-detail page still clipped on phones after the child-level fixes). Mechanical sweep: every `className="grid gap-…"` in admin/ops components and pages is now `grid min-w-0 grid-cols-1 gap-…` (`grid-cols-1` = `minmax(0,1fr)`, clamps to container; existing `sm:`/`lg:` column overrides untouched). Covers the order detail page + fulfillment panel (the reported surface) and 40 other files.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (admin/ops components + pages, structural classes only)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the sweep commit
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.55 (shipment-sync 500 fix).


## [0.1.33] — 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Footer social icons are now real, merchant-managed links.** The F/I/T placeholder circles are replaced with official Facebook / Instagram / WhatsApp brand glyphs from `react-icons` (new pinned dependency 5.5.0 — the sanctioned exception to the Lucide-only rule, used ONLY for brand logos; imports are tree-shaken). Facebook/Instagram URLs come from the new Admin → Settings → Store fields (via `GET /store/config`); the WhatsApp icon opens `wa.me/<contactPhone>` using the same number shown in the footer (bare 10-digit numbers get +91). Icons render only when configured — no dead links.
- **Admin → Settings → Store: "Facebook Link" and "Instagram Link" fields** (blank clears the link and hides the icon; helper text explains WhatsApp needs no link).
- **Category image upload in the admin category editor.** Single optional image with instant preview: edit mode uploads immediately to `POST /admin/categories/:id/image/upload` (same CDN pipeline as product images); create mode holds the file and uploads right after the category is created (an upload failure surfaces a toast but never rolls back the category). Storefront category cards now show the merchant image when set and the neutral product placeholder when not — the hardcoded Unsplash stock-photo fallbacks in `lib/categories.ts` are gone.

### Changed
- **"Resend notification" resends the order's CURRENT status** — the button no longer hardcodes `OrderConfirmed`; the backend derives the template from the live order status (backend-core 0.1.51). Tooltip updated accordingly.
- **Admin API client retries idempotent GETs once after a 429** (1.2s delay). Combined with the backend admin rate-limit raise (backend-core 0.1.51), rapidly switching admin sections no longer flashes "Something went wrong" across panels. (The dashboard/analytics panels were always wired to real endpoints — the rate-limit bursts were killing their calls.)

### Fixed
- **Admin coupons page looked completely broken — active coupons (e.g. FREEDELIVERY) missing.** The page's date range (default: last 7 days) was passed into the coupon LIST, the Total/Active/Expired KPI counts, and the CSV export — and the backend's `from/to` filters coupons by `createdAt`, so every coupon created before the window silently vanished while still being active. The list and export now always show ALL coupons; Total/Active/Expired KPIs are point-in-time; only usage analytics (Total Uses / Total Discounts) stay range-scoped.
- **Coupons no longer stick across checkout visits.** The backend keeps `couponId` on the cart until an order is created, so a coupon applied in an abandoned checkout silently carried over to the next visit/order. Checkout now clears any leftover coupon once on mount (idempotent; guests get their reserved usage released), guards against clobbering a coupon applied during the visit, and re-syncs the cart after the reset to close the stale-fetch race.
- **Add to cart / Buy now buttons look right.** `AddToCartButton` wrapped its `<button>` in a stray `grid` div, so `flex-1`/`shrink-0` on the button never reached the flex row (unequal widths), and the default icon rendered with no gap beside the label. The button is now the root element; PDP CTAs got `gap-2 px-6 shadow-sm` + disabled styling, and Buy now uses a lightning icon instead of a second cart icon.
- **Mobile menu no longer pops the keyboard.** Opening the storefront mobile menu auto-focused the search field, which immediately raised the software keyboard over the menu. The autofocus is removed — tap the field to search.
- **Product detail "Additional Information": Origin row removed** (Category / Certification / Storage remain).

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (storefront + admin components, `lib/storefront-settings.ts`, `lib/admin-api.ts`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none (brand glyphs inherit the token palette) · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the listed files
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.51 (StoreSettings social-link columns + /store/config exposure).

## [0.1.32] — 2026-07-04

### Added
- **Variant selection directly on product cards.** The variant chips ("250gms / 500gms / 1kg") are now buttons: tapping one switches the displayed price/strikethrough/discount badge and the Add button adds that exact variant to the cart — no detail-page detour to buy a specific size. Chips render in the merchant's admin sort order (the backend already orders variants by `sortOrder`, then price); up to 4 chips show, extra variants collapse into a "+N" link to the detail page. Selection logic extracted to `lib/product-card-variants.ts` with unit tests. Mobile-optimized: ≥28px chip tap targets, wrapping price/Add row (50vw cards can't fit both on one line), tighter padding, `min-w-0` guards.

### Fixed
- **Mobile overflow hardening across admin/ops sections (the "broken padding" class of bugs).** Root cause fixed at the source: `AdminSection`'s root was `grid` with an *implicit* auto column — implicit tracks size to content, so any wide child (data table, long AWB/email, unwrapped filter row) inflated the whole section past the mobile viewport; the shell's `overflow-x-hidden` then clipped the right edge, which read as broken padding. Now `grid grid-cols-1 min-w-0` (`grid-cols-1` = `minmax(0,1fr)` — clamps to container). Same hardening on the other implicit-grid card roots (`AdminMutationPanel`, orders filter card, `AdminOrderDetailPanel`, `OpsSessionPanel`, ops-ui card) and `AdminTableScroll` (`min-w-0 max-w-full`). Return-request status stepper scrolls horizontally on narrow phones; shipment drawer `Row` values wrap with `break-words`; coupon Discount-Type cards shrink correctly in their 3-column mobile grid.
- **Sidebar Orders badge + bell are now genuinely live.** Poll tightened 60s → 20s (the count query is `limit=1`, meta.total only), added a `window focus` listener (`visibilitychange` never fires when switching between desktop windows — the tab stays "visible"), refresh on every in-console route change, and the open bell panel itself now refetches on admin data mutations + a 20s poll instead of only on open/manual refresh.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (admin/ops components) · Migration: NO · Flag: none
- Design impact: none (structural classes + polling only) · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the 11 component files
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.50 (BullMQ jobId fix — the backend half of "notifications not arriving").

## [0.1.31] — 2026-07-03

### Changed
- **Admin badge counts are now live.** The sidebar Orders badge + bell count refetch (1) instantly after any in-app order mutation via the `notifyAdminDataChanged` bus, (2) every 60s in the background (skipped while the tab is hidden), and (3) immediately when the tab regains focus — no more page refresh to see new orders.
- **"Request refund" removed from the fulfilment panel** — refunds are issued via "Cancel order" (auto-refunds prepaid); a standalone refund action on a live order invited mistakes. Refund state still shows in the payment chip; the backend refund route remains available to the status-management surface.
- **"Retrigger email" → "Resend notification"** (with a tooltip explaining what it resends).

### Fixed
- Coupon panel on admin order detail now populates (backend-core 0.1.46 stopped stripping the `coupon` object) — FREE_SHIPPING coupons render as "Free Shipping".

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (`components/admin/{AdminConsoleShell,AdminOrderFulfillmentPanel}.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the two files
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.46.

## [0.1.30] — 2026-07-03

### Changed
- **Cart page promo-code box removed** — coupon entry lives at checkout only (`CheckoutForm` keeps apply/remove). The cart summary is a clean recap; an applied coupon still shows as the Discount line. Dead coupon state/handlers/imports stripped from `CartWorkspace`.

### Fixed
- **Admin fulfilment panel hides Ship/Schedule-pickup/Print-label entirely on cancelled/refunded orders** (and cancelled shipments), replaced by a terminal notice — pairs with the backend 409 guards (backend-core 0.1.44). `InfoChip` values now wrap (`min-w-0 break-words`) so long mono AWBs can't inflate the panel.
- **Mobile viewport overflow sweep (admin + storefront):**
  - Admin orders list: date/export filter rows stack in a 2-col grid on phones (was a fixed non-shrinking flex row that pushed the page wider than the screen).
  - Admin order detail + product editor: `min-w-0` on all layout-grid children (grid items default to `min-width:auto`; wide content — tables, mono refs, long slugs — inflated columns past the viewport and got clipped by the shell's `overflow-x-hidden`).
  - Checkout: progress-stepper connectors narrowed on phones (4 steps + labels now fit 375px); `min-w-0` wrappers on the checkout grid children (form + sidebar) and the cart Order Summary column.
- **Generic-500 companion:** the backend's new generic 500 message added to `GENERIC_BACKEND_MESSAGES` so ops/admin panels don't echo it as a redundant "Server: …" detail line.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (`components/cart/CartWorkspace.tsx`, `components/admin/{AdminOrderFulfillmentPanel,AdminOrderDetailPageClient,AdminOrdersList,AdminProductEditor}.tsx`, `app/(storefront)/checkout/page.tsx`, `lib/error-messages.ts`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the listed files
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.44.

## [0.1.29] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Header mini-cart dropdown** (`components/cart/CartDropdown.tsx`, new). Clicking the cart icon now opens a small popover anchored directly below the icon — current cart lines (thumbnail, name, variant · qty × unit price, line total), subtotal, empty state, and a **Go to Cart** button — instead of navigating straight to `/cart`. Viewport-aware: fixed 320px panel on desktop, clamped to `calc(100vw-1.5rem)` on mobile so it never overflows; closes on outside tap/click and Escape; count badge and header price label preserved exactly (markup moved from `MainNav` into the trigger).

### Fixed
- **Order-detail invoice totals were horizontally clipped on mobile.** Subtotal/Discount/Shipping/Total lived inside the `overflow-x-auto` line-items table, so on narrow screens they scrolled out of view ("Subt…", "To…"). Totals now render as a static block OUTSIDE the scroll container (always fully visible); the Unit Price column folds into the item cell on mobile (`… each`), letting the table min-width drop 420→340px.
- **PDP overflowed the mobile viewport (content clipped at the right edge, no wrap).** Root cause: the gallery thumbnail strip (`overflow-x-auto`) sits inside a CSS-grid item, and grid items default to `min-width:auto` — the strip's intrinsic width inflated the column past the viewport, and the body's `overflow-x-hidden` clipped everything instead of scrolling. Added `min-w-0` to the PDP grid children (gallery + info panel). Same latent guard applied to the other grid-item scroll/flex containers: `AccountNav` (account grid child with `overflow-x-auto`), the account content column, and the cart items column.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: HIGH (PDP unreadable on phones) · Layers: frontend (`components/cart/CartDropdown.tsx` new, `components/layout/MainNav.tsx`, `components/layout/AccountNav.tsx`, `components/cart/CartWorkspace.tsx`, `app/(storefront)/products/[slug]/page.tsx`, `app/(account)/{layout.tsx,orders/[id]/page.tsx}`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: uses existing palette tokens/hexes · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the listed files

## [0.1.28] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- **"Return request update" row in Admin → Settings → Notifications per-template routing** — merchants can toggle Email / SMS / WhatsApp for return-decision notifications (backend-core 0.1.42 routes them via `send-primary`). WhatsApp requires the approved `return_request_update` Meta template; the existing provisioned/enabled guards apply as for every other row.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: LOW (one routing row) · Layers: frontend (`components/admin/NotificationsChannelPanel.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the file

## [0.1.27] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Merchant returns toggle + return-status UX** (pairs with backend-core 0.1.41):
  - Admin → Settings → Store Policies: new **"Allow Order Returns"** checkbox (`CodSettingsPanel`) saved via the cod-settings PATCH.
  - `PublicStoreConfig.returnsEnabled` (fail-closed `false`) via `useStoreConfig()`.
  - Customer order detail: **Return Request status card** (chip + filed date + reason + store note); the "Request a Return / Replacement" CTA renders only when returns are enabled, the order is DELIVERED, and no request is in flight — mirroring the server guards. `OrderSummary.returnRequests` typed.
  - Admin return detail: the status pills now offer only **valid next transitions** (mirrors the backend guard: `REQUESTED→APPROVED/REJECTED`, `APPROVED→PICKED_UP/REJECTED`, `PICKED_UP→REFUNDED`; terminals immutable) instead of every status.
- Order numbers are display-only on the frontend — the new random `ORD-XXXX-XXXX` format (backend-core 0.1.41) needs no frontend changes; verified nothing parses the format.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (additive UI; server enforces everything) · Layers: frontend (`components/admin/{CodSettingsPanel,AdminReturnDetailPanel}.tsx`, `app/(account)/orders/[id]/page.tsx`, `lib/{storefront-settings.ts,orders-api.ts}` + tests)
- Migration: NO · Flag: merchant toggle (default ON) · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the listed files

## [0.1.26] — 2026-07-03

### Changed
- **Order detail page redesigned as a modern SaaS-style document.** Sectioned cards (shared `DetailCard` shell) in the account palette:
  - **Header**: order number + colour-mapped status chip + placed date/payment mode; actions (Invoice PDF, Retry Payment, Cancel) grouped right; back-link to orders.
  - **Items**: each line shows the product image thumbnail (`next/image`, placeholder fallback), name, variant, qty × unit price and line total — and **deep-links to that product & variant on the storefront** (`/products/<slug>?variant=<id>`) when still purchasable (backend-core 0.1.40 enrichment). `ProductVariantSelector` now honours a `?variant=` query param (read from `window.location` on mount — no `useSearchParams`, so the PDP stays statically cacheable with no Suspense requirement).
  - **Invoice**: proper invoice-style `<table>` (Item / Qty / Unit Price / Amount) with Subtotal, Discount (green, coupon code chip), Shipping ("Free" at 0) and accent Total in the footer; shows invoice number + issue date and a Download PDF action when `invoice.hasPdf`. Mobile: horizontal scroll.
  - **Tracking**: timeline list with dot markers (latest highlighted); address card; return-request form restyled. All action feedback (cancel, return submit, invoice download) now uses toasts.
  - Shared status helpers extracted to `lib/order-status-ui.ts` (used by orders list + detail). `OrderLineItem` gains optional `productSlug`/`imageUrl`/`isPurchasable`; `OrderSummary` gains `createdAt`.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (visual; additive types) · Layers: frontend (`app/(account)/orders/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/(account)/orders/page.tsx`, `components/product/ProductVariantSelector.tsx`, `lib/{orders-api.ts,order-status-ui.ts}`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: account palette tokens/hexes · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the listed files
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.40 (order item PDP enrichment).

## [0.1.25] — 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **Order detail page crashed with "useStoreConfig must be used within StoreConfigProvider".** The `(account)` route group's layout didn't mount `StoreConfigProvider` — only the storefront layout did — so `/orders/[id]` (whose `OrderReviewPrompt` reads `useStoreConfig().reviewsEnabled`) threw the error boundary on every visit. The account layout now mirrors the storefront layout: it fetches categories + public store config and wraps everything in `StoreConfigProvider`.
- **Account pages now share the storefront chrome.** The same fix adds the site `Header` (nav, search, cart) and `Footer` to all account pages (`/dashboard`, `/orders`, `/orders/[id]`, `/addresses`, `/settings`), which previously rendered as bare standalone pages. Session bootstrap in the Header and the AccountGuard share the same deduped customer restore, so no double refresh-token consumption.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: HIGH (order detail page was broken for customers) · Layers: frontend (`app/(account)/layout.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none (uses existing chrome) · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the file (restores the crash)
- Follow-up to 0.1.24 (account redesign).

## [0.1.24] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Customer account area redesigned as a modern SaaS-style profile** (all in the existing brand palette):
  - **`AccountNav`** (new, `components/layout/AccountNav.tsx`): icon nav with active-route highlight; desktop sidebar gets a profile card (avatar initial, name, contact) and a **Sign out** action; mobile keeps a compact horizontal pill bar.
  - **Addresses** now has its own page (`/addresses`, new): card-grid address book with Default badge, set-default / edit / delete, inline add/edit form (react-hook-form + zod), toast feedback. Moved out of Settings; dashboard quick-link now points at it (was `/settings`).
  - **Settings** rebuilt: sectioned Profile card (name/email) and a **Mobile Number card — add, change, or remove the login phone** (backend-core 0.1.39). Removal shows a confirm explaining OTP sign-in is lost; server refuses removal when the phone is the only sign-in identifier. Addresses shortcut card links to the new page.
  - **Order History** restyled: status chips (colour-mapped per status), order date + payment mode, invoice download + View actions as proper buttons, skeletons/empty states in the account palette.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (visual + additive; API surface unchanged except `phone` on the profile PATCH) · Layers: frontend (`components/layout/AccountNav.tsx` new, `app/(account)/{layout,dashboard/page,orders/page,settings/page}.tsx`, `app/(account)/addresses/page.tsx` new, `lib/users-api.ts`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: uses the existing storefront palette tokens/hexes · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the listed files
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.39 (phone add/update/remove on `PATCH /users/me`). NOTE: this tag also delivers 0.1.23 (variant "Deactivate instead?" flow), whose tag was never pushed.

## [0.1.23] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- **"Deactivate instead?" flow on variant delete.** When deleting a variant returns the 409 (it appears in existing orders and must be preserved for invoices/history), the product editor now offers a confirm dialog explaining the trade-off and — on confirm — PATCHes `isActive: false`. The variant disappears from the storefront and (per backend-core 0.1.38) from live customer carts; already-placed orders keep flowing untouched. Success toast: "Variant deactivated — removed from storefront and customer carts."

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (UX for the 409 path) · Layers: frontend (`components/admin/AdminProductEditor.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the file
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.38 (deactivation cart purge + checkout inactive-item guard).

## [0.1.22] — 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **Specific 409/400 backend explanations are no longer swallowed by generic copy.** `getApiErrorMessage` mapped every `CONFLICT` to "This action conflicts with the current state…" and every `VALIDATION_ERROR` to "Please check the highlighted fields…" — so the variant-delete 409's clear "Cannot delete a variant that appears in existing orders. **Deactivate it instead.**" never reached the user, and fieldless `VALIDATION_ERROR`s (e.g. "Cannot delete the last variant of a product") showed "check the highlighted fields" with **nothing highlighted**. The mapper now surfaces specific crafted `CONFLICT`/`VALIDATION_ERROR` server messages (same rule `getApiErrorMessageWithHint` already used); schema-level "Request validation failed" keeps the generic copy, and when the backend DOES send field details the existing `useAdminFormValidation` highlighting/scroll behaviour is unchanged. One central fix — every call site (admin + storefront) benefits. Regression tests added.

### Changed
- **Toaster moved to the TOP-RIGHT and enlarged on desktop.** Mobile: spans the top with safe-area insets, compact sizing. Desktop: fixed ~440px column anchored top-right with larger text/padding so it's clearly visible on big screens. Slide-in now comes from the right.
- **Toast rollout across the remaining admin mutation panels.** Converted `AdminCategoryEditor`, `AdminCategoryForm`, `AdminOrderFulfillmentPanel`, `AdminOrderItemsPanel`, `AdminOrderStatusPanel`, `BoxPresetsPanel`, `CodSettingsPanel`, `InventorySettingsPanel`, `ShippingSettingsPanel` — error/success state now mirrors into global toasts and the in-panel/inline banners are removed. Combined with 0.1.20's conversions, every admin mutation surface (settings saves, product/category editing, order ship/cancel/status/items, box presets) now reports via the top-right toast. List/dashboard **load-failure** states intentionally remain inline (a 3s toast vanishing would leave a blank table with no explanation).

**Propagation:**
- Severity: HIGH (users couldn't see why deletes/saves were being refused) · Layers: frontend (`lib/error-messages.ts` + test, `components/ui/Toaster.tsx`, 9 × `components/admin/*.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the listed files
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.37 (variant-delete 409) — the 409's "Deactivate it instead" now actually shows in the toast.

## [0.1.21] — 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **VPS frontend build broke: `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/shared/Toaster'`.** 0.1.20 put the new `Toaster` in `components/shared/`, but that directory is **not** in the core sync manifest (only `components/{ui,layout,admin,product,cart,checkout}/**` are) — so `Toaster.tsx` never synced to client repos, while the core `app/layout.tsx` that imports it did. `next build` (run on deploy) failed on the dangling import. (Client `reliability-gates` doesn't run a full `next build`, so it slipped through.) Moved `Toaster.tsx` → `components/ui/Toaster.tsx` (a core-synced directory; a Toaster is a UI primitive) and updated the import. No behaviour change.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: HIGH (breaks the frontend production build on deploy) · Layers: frontend (`components/ui/Toaster.tsx` moved from `components/shared/`, `app/layout.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: n/a (roll up with 0.1.20). Note: `components/shared/**` remains outside the core manifest — new files there won't sync; keep shared core components under a manifested directory (`components/ui`, `components/layout`, …).

## [0.1.20] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Global toast/popup notification system** to replace the large top-of-page inline banners with a small, viewport-aware popup on the LEFT that auto-dismisses in ~3s. New: `stores/toast.ts` (store — auto-dismiss, duplicate-collapse, max-4 cap), `lib/toast.ts` (`toast.success/error/info/warning(...)` helper usable from any event handler), and `components/shared/Toaster.tsx` (framer-motion renderer, mounted once in the root layout). Responsive by viewport: on mobile it spans the bottom with insets and compact sizing; on desktop it's a fixed ~380px column anchored bottom-left. Brand-independent status colours, `aria-live` announcements, honours `prefers-reduced-motion`, click-to-dismiss.

### Changed
- **Converted the highest-traffic surfaces to toasts** (pattern for the rest): admin `AdminProductEditor` (the save/variant error+success banners → toasts, incl. the variant-delete failure), admin `StoreSettingsPanel` and `NotificationsChannelPanel` (in-panel error/success banners → toasts), and storefront `AddToCartButton` (success "Added to cart" + error toast, inline error removed). Inline **field-validation highlighting** is unchanged (still driven by `useAdminFormValidation`); only the big status banners moved to toasts.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (additive UX system; converted surfaces are backward-compatible) · Layers: frontend (`stores/toast.ts`, `lib/toast.ts` + test, `components/shared/Toaster.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, `components/admin/{AdminProductEditor,StoreSettingsPanel,NotificationsChannelPanel}.tsx`, `components/cart/AddToCartButton.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none (status colours are brand-independent; layout-neutral overlay) · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the listed files (unmounting `<Toaster/>` disables it; other panels still use their inline banners)
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.37 (variant-delete 409 fix — its clean error now shows as a toast in the product editor). Remaining admin panels still use inline banners and can be migrated incrementally by mirroring `error`/`success` state into `toast.*` and removing the banner JSX.

## [0.1.19] — 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **Storefront header support phone is now merchant-managed, not hardcoded.** `components/layout/Header.tsx` hard-coded one client's "Call Us 24/7" number (and would ship it to every client via core sync). It now reads `contactPhone` from the public store config (`useStoreConfig()`) — the same source the Footer already uses — and hides the whole phone block (and its divider) when no number is set. Merchants edit it in **Admin → Settings → Store Profile**, alongside the store address.

### Changed
- **Re-added Contact Phone + Contact Email to the admin Store Profile panel.** `StoreSettingsPanel` previously showed a note saying these were "removed to simplify configuration"; they're now editable fields (loaded from `GET /admin/settings/store`, saved via the existing PATCH — backend already accepted `contactPhone`/`contactEmail`). This makes the header/footer contact details self-service for merchants, no backend seeding needed.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (removes a cross-client branding leak; adds merchant self-service) · Layers: frontend (`components/layout/Header.tsx`, `components/admin/StoreSettingsPanel.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none (header phone now data-driven; hidden when unset) · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the two files
- No backend change: `StoreSettings.contactPhone`/`contactEmail` were already read/written by `/admin/settings/store` and exposed in `/store/config`. After sync, each merchant should set their number in Admin → Settings → Store Profile (until then the header phone block is simply hidden).

## [0.1.18] — 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- **Session-restore no longer spuriously logs out valid sessions on slow mobile networks.** `useAuthSessionRestore` raced the cookie-restore round-trip (refresh + profile fetch) against an **8s** deadline; on 3G/weak links the request eventually succeeds but the race already resolved `unauthorised`, so the hook cleared the session and **permanently blocked** any retry for that load — the "works on desktop, drops on mobile" report. Fixes: (1) deadline 8s → **15s** (a genuinely dead request still fails fast on its own, so this only helps slow-but-working connections); (2) the timeout now resolves a distinct `"timeout"` reason that the handler treats as a **soft, retryable** failure — it does not set `blocked` and does not clear a possibly-valid session, so a remount/navigation/nonce bump can try again. Only a definitive `unauthorised`/`invalid_token` still hard-clears + blocks.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: HIGH (valid sessions dropped on mobile) · Layers: frontend (`hooks/use-auth-session-restore.ts`, `lib/restore-auth-session.ts`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: none · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the two files
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.36 (refresh cookie `SameSite=Lax`). Together they address the "logged out on refresh / after idle / only on mobile" reports.

## [0.1.17] — 2026-07-02

### Changed
- **Notifications panel is now MULTI-select (on/off per channel), not single-primary.** `NotificationsChannelPanel` renders independent Email / SMS / WhatsApp toggles per notification — a notification is sent to EVERY enabled channel. `primaryChannels` is now `Record<string, Channel[]>` (was a single value); the panel seeds from arrays (accepting legacy single-string values) and PATCHes arrays. Only provisioned channels are enableable; OTP rows show an amber hint when WhatsApp is selected but the ops `OTP_WHATSAPP_ENABLED` gate is off. `providerAvailability.otpWhatsappEnabled` added to the settings type.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (feature) · Layers: frontend (`lib/admin-api.ts`, `components/admin/NotificationsChannelPanel.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none (token-styled) · Breaking: NO (reads legacy single-string values)
- Rollback: revert the two files
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.30 (multi-channel routing + fan-out).

## [0.1.16] — 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- **`OTP_WHATSAPP_ENABLED` now renders as a true/false dropdown in the Ops → Config editor** (added to `BOOLEAN_KEYS` in `lib/ops-config-fields.ts`). Previously it appeared as a plain text box. All notification toggles (`NOTIFY_*`, `OTP_WHATSAPP_ENABLED`) are now consistent boolean selects, saved to the DB overlay via the OTP-protected config-save. `WHATSAPP_OTP_COST_PAISE` stays a text input (numeric value).

**Propagation:**
- Severity: LOW (UX polish) · Layers: frontend (`lib/ops-config-fields.ts`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the one line
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.26 (which defines the key).

## [0.1.15] — 2026-07-02

### Added
- **WhatsApp OTP cost card on Ops → Config.** `OpsConfigPagePanel` now fetches `GET /ops/notifications/whatsapp-otp-cost` (new `getWhatsappOtpCostClient` + `WhatsappOtpCostEstimate` type in `lib/ops-client-api.ts`) and renders a small read-only card showing estimated WhatsApp-OTP spend for the current billing cycle and all-time, plus the per-message rate. Best-effort — if the endpoint fails the card is hidden and the config page is unaffected. Shown regardless of whether OTP-over-WhatsApp is enabled (it reports historical sends).

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (feature) · Layers: frontend (`lib/ops-client-api.ts`, `components/ops/OpsConfigPagePanel.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a (read-only display) · Design impact: none (token-styled `OpsCard`/`OpsBadge`) · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the two files
- Pairs with backend-core 0.1.26 (the endpoint + `OTP_WHATSAPP_ENABLED`/`WHATSAPP_OTP_COST_PAISE` keys).

## [0.1.14] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **"Enable Customer Reviews" toggle in the admin settings panel.** `CodSettingsPanel` (Admin → Settings → COD & Sign-up) gains a Storefront Features card with a reviews on/off switch, wired to `GET`/`PATCH /admin/settings/cod` (`reviewsEnabled`). Replaces the build-time `FEATURE_REVIEWS_ENABLED` env flag — merchants turn reviews on/off themselves; the storefront (`reviewsEnabled` from `/store/config`) reflects it without a redeploy.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (`components/admin/CodSettingsPanel.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a (this IS the toggle UI) · Design impact: none (existing tokens) · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the file
- Requires backend-core 0.1.23 (`StoreSettings.reviewsEnabled` + `/admin/settings/cod` field).

## [0.1.13] — 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Reviews visible on product cards + customer write-review UI.** `ProductCard` now renders the star `Rating` (avg + count) under the product name when `reviewsEnabled` and the product has approved reviews (the PDP header + `ProductReviewsSection` already showed reviews). New `OrderReviewPrompt` on the account order-detail page: for a **DELIVERED** order it fetches the reviewable products (`GET /reviews/eligible`) and renders a per-product star input + optional comment that submits via `POST /reviews`, with already-reviewed and pending-approval states. `reviews-api.ts` gains `getReviewableProducts` + `ReviewableProduct`. Consumes the new `rating`/`reviewCount` fields on the product list/detail responses.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (new feature) · Layers: frontend (`components/product/ProductCard.tsx`, `components/product/OrderReviewPrompt.tsx` [new], `lib/reviews-api.ts`, `app/(account)/orders/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: gated on `reviewsEnabled` from `GET /store/config` (driven by backend `FEATURE_REVIEWS_ENABLED`) · Design impact: none (uses existing `Rating` + tokens) · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the listed files
- Requires backend-core 0.1.22 (rating aggregates + `/reviews/eligible`).

## [0.1.12] — 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Drag-and-drop variant ordering in the admin product editor.** The "Manage All Product Variants" table has a grip handle per row; dragging reorders variants (native HTML5 DnD, no new dependency), persists via `PATCH /admin/products/:id/variants/reorder` (optimistic, reverts on failure), and that order is what the storefront shows on the product page and product cards. `AdminProductVariant` carries `sortOrder`.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (`lib/admin-api.ts`, `components/admin/AdminProductEditor.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none (uses existing tokens + Lucide `GripVertical`) · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the two files · Requires backend-core 0.1.17.
- Note: storefront needed no change — adapters/selector already render variants in API order, which is now `sortOrder`.

## [0.1.11] — 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **Compare-at price field no longer shows/sends a stale `0`.** `formatVariantCompareAtPriceInput` and the variant-table draft seeding now treat `compareAtPrice <= 0` as empty (legacy `0` data from the old backend bug), and `buildPrimaryVariantPricePatch` sends `null` for a blank/`0` field. Combined with backend-core 0.1.15 this stops the spurious "Compare-at price must be greater than the price" error on save and cleans the bad value.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (`lib/admin-product-pricing.ts`, `components/admin/AdminProductEditor.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the two files · Requires backend-core 0.1.15.

## [0.1.10] — 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **Admin product editor — "Manage All Product Variants" table no longer cramped on desktop.** The 11-column variant edit table was constrained to `min-w-[600px]` (~54px/column), squishing every input to an unusable box with truncated values. Widened the table to `min-w-[1180px]` and gave each editable cell a sensible min-width (SKU 110, Name 140, Price/Compare 104, Weight 84, L/W/H 68px), so fields are fully readable; the table continues to scroll horizontally within `AdminTableScroll`.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: LOW (admin CSS/layout only) · Layers: frontend (`components/admin/AdminProductEditor.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none (Tailwind width utilities only) · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the component

## [0.1.9] — 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- **Admin product editor — add-variant `weight` bug + Compare-at-Price clarity.** `addVariant` sent `weightGrams` (rejected by the backend schema's `additionalProperties:false`, so adding a variant *with a weight* failed); now sends `weight`. Compare-at-Price is labelled **(optional)** with a clearer tooltip, and the description character counter shows the correct `/5000` limit. The inline add/edit variant handlers now surface backend `VALIDATION_ERROR` field details (via `handleSubmitError`) instead of a generic message, so the admin sees exactly which field was wrong.
- **Store address is now always editable in Admin → Settings → Store (was hidden unless GST invoicing was on).** `StoreSettingsPanel` was rendering the entire seller section — including the storefront-footer **Store Address** — only when `gstInvoicingEnabled`. The Store Details card (legal name, address, operating state) is now always shown/saved; only GSTIN/FSSAI remain gated behind GST invoicing. Save button/labels reworded to "Store Settings".

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL (admin UX bug fixes) · Layers: frontend (`components/admin/AdminProductEditor.tsx`, `components/admin/StoreSettingsPanel.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the two components
- Note: requires backend-core 0.1.14 (`compareAtPrice` null handling). Address persistence already supported by `updateStoreProfile` (no backend change needed for the address itself).

## [0.1.8] — 2026-06-28

### Added
- **"Keep upright" packing flag in the admin product editor.** `AdminProductVariant` carries `keepUpright`; the variant edit row (new "Upright" column), the add-variant form, and the create-product primary-variant card each expose a checkbox. It is sent on variant create/update so fragile / this-side-up / liquid items are only rotated about their vertical axis during shipping cartonization. `BoxPresetsPanel` copy now notes the +1 cm padding and the keep-upright behavior.
- **"Packing box" card on the admin order detail.** `AdminOrderDetailPanel` renders the `packingBox` returned by `GET /admin/orders/:id` (dimensions, weight, source/box name) so the merchant sees the exact carton used to rate the order and can pack into it. `AdminOrderDetailFull` carries the optional `packingBox`.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (`lib/admin-api.ts`, `components/admin/AdminProductEditor.tsx`, `components/admin/BoxPresetsPanel.tsx`, `components/admin/AdminOrderDetailPanel.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none (uses existing admin form controls) · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the three files
- Note: requires backend-core 0.1.13 (the `keepUpright` field + cartonization refinement).


## [0.1.7] — 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Merchant-managed store address/contact in the storefront footer.** `PublicStoreConfig` (`lib/storefront-settings.ts`) now carries `storeName`/`storeAddress`/`storeState`/`contactEmail`/`contactPhone` from `GET /store/config`; the storefront `Footer` reads them via `useStoreConfig()` (now a client component) with safe fallbacks, so the address/phone/email update from Admin → Settings → Store without a code change. `StoreSettingsPanel` clarifies the address is shown on the storefront.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (`lib/storefront-settings.ts`, `components/admin/StoreSettingsPanel.tsx`); `components/layout/Footer.tsx` is per-client (design layer) — wire each client's footer to `useStoreConfig()` as desired.
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none (footer markup unchanged, values now dynamic) · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the lib + panel
- Note: requires backend-core 0.1.12 (public config exposes the fields).


## [0.1.6] — 2026-06-22

### Changed
- **`BoxPresetsPanel`** (admin → Settings → Shipping) now explains cartonization: presets are the real cartons the order's items are 3D-packed into (smallest fitting box wins; bounding-box fallback; +2cm padding; volumetric billing), and that accuracy depends on per-variant box dimensions set in the product editor.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: LOW (admin copy only) · Layers: frontend (`components/admin/BoxPresetsPanel.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the component

## [0.1.5] — 2026-06-22

> Note: tags `0.1.2`–`0.1.4` were cut without CHANGELOG/`package.json` bumps on main; this entry realigns frontend-core to 0.1.5.

### Fixed
- **Admin product editor — variant box dimensions now editable on existing variants.** The variant edit row only exposed a Weight input; Length/Width/Height (cm) were missing, so per-variant box dimensions couldn't be changed after creation (the save handler already sent them). Added L/W/H columns + inputs to the edit row, matching the add-variant form. These dimensions feed backend shipping cartonization (backend-core 0.1.9), so accurate per-variant box sizes reach Shiprocket/Delhivery.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL · Layers: frontend (`components/admin/AdminProductEditor.tsx`)
- Migration: NO · Flag: n/a · Design impact: none · Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the component
- Note: the admin console (`components/admin/**`) is core-synced as of this release (added to `core-manifest.json` in backend-core 0.1.9) — admin fixes now propagate to all clients automatically.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-20

### Added
- Admin product editor shows an ephemeral green-tick success toast (`role="status"`, auto-dismisses after 2s) after a successful product image upload, in addition to the persistent success banner.

**Propagation:**
- Severity: NORMAL
- Layers: frontend (`components/admin/AdminProductEditor.tsx`)
- Requires backend-core: >= 0.1.0
- Flag: n/a
- Design impact: none (uses existing admin success-color utilities)
- Breaking: NO
- Rollback: revert the AdminProductEditor change
